       "      <td>Hey guys!  \\n\\nHere's a link to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3sldxd/i_found_a_locked_room_in_the_basement_of_my_new/ \\n\\n\\nFirstly I would like to thank all of you who came to aid me in this dark situation, many of you had some great advice. Some of you were also definitely right in pointing out that I was an idiot for opening the hatch even though it clearly said not to. That was intensely stupid and believe me, I will not make that mistake again.  \\n\\n\\nSorry for the wall of text, but in the last week a lot has transpired. A few hours after posting, Chris arrived, which was a huge relief for me. He'd swung by his parents' house and picked up his dad's shotgun. That night was relatively quiet, I slept like a log after being awake for so long the night before. Afterwards Chris told me that he did hear that clicking sound I described before, although only for a few seconds, then it was gone. He didn't feel particularly compelled to go check it out in the middle of the night, so he just went back to sleep.\\n  \\nThat morning I called the realtor. I was a bit hesitant to tell him about the creature I saw, for fear that he might think I'm crazy. So I just told him I found a hatch and I would like to find out what it was for. He reacted rather dismissively, but when I told him about the plaque that said \"KEEP SHUT AT ALL TIMES\" and that I opened it anyway, he relented. The previous resident died (of natural causes, in a hospital, don't worry, I asked), leaving the house to his only son. The son had no interest in living in it so he put it on the market. The realtor said he'd give him a call and he'd get back to me.  \\n\\nAfter that, Chris and I got ready to check out the basement. I was holding the flashlight and he was armed with the shotgun. We agreed I'd shine the flashlight into the hatch and he'd try to see what's in there. With my heart in my throat I walked down the basement stairs. I went and stood next to the hatch first and aimed the light in from an angle. Chris took a deep breath and hopped off of the staircase. He walked up next to me and quietly lay the barrel of the gun in the opening. With his finger on the trigger he peered in. Although he initially seemed tense, he calmed down after that. \\n\\n'It's just an empty room,' he said, 'It's kinda big, but apart from that it's pretty much just the basement minus the old junk, ha-ha.' I laughed nervously and was about to ask to go upstairs again, when, all of a sudden, a loud bang! Despite the fact that we'd worn earplugs as protection, my ears were ringing like crazy. I looked over to Chris just in time to see him fire the gun a second time. I stared in shock as my ears rang even worse. After that, he pulled the gun out, shut the hatch and locked it.  \\n\\nWhen my hearing had finally returned, Chris explained what he'd seen. 'It was just like the creature that you described, but it wasn't just one of them. There must have been at least two, maybe three. I was about to propose going upstairs again when I saw something glisten in a dark corner. At first I thought it was just water or something, but then it moved. Turns out it was its eyes! But I definitely saw more than one pair of eyes.' \\n\\nThe rest of the day the atmosphere was glum. We didn't really know what to say to each other and we couldn't relax after what just happened. \\nI couldn't make much sense of it all until after dinner, when I got an email.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\n*Hello Claire and Chris,* \\n\\n*I am the guy you bought the house from! The realtor passed me your contact info, I hope you don't mind. I am so sorry that no one told you about the hatch and I am really sorry that you opened it, that was a very bad idea.*  \\n\\n*Also, sorry, if what I'm about to tell you next is in too much gruesome detail for you, but I want to illustrate how these things are a force to be reckoned with. If you can, just leave. Seriously.* \\n\\n*My parents bought the house in '84 as a getaway for the weekends and the holidays, although, in the end, we only spent about a week there as a family.*  \\n\\n*It was the end of June when we first arrived. We were supposed to stay there for a whole month. As a ten-year-old with no siblings I was pretty bummed to spend most of the summer in the middle of nowhere. So on the way there and all of the first day, I was whining, crying and droning on that I wanted to go home. I guess that's why my parents didn't take me too seriously when I told them that I'd seen a monster that night. It was about nine PM and the sun had just gone under. It was the holidays, so I was allowed to stay up longer than usual. I was out, playing on the porch with my toys as I heard a rattling sound coming from deeper in the woods. I got up to get a better look and that's when I saw a tall figure standing in between the trees, only barely lit by the moonlight. At first I thought it was maybe one of the neighbors and naively I called out to it. It definitely heard me and it approached. As it crept closer I noticed that something was really off about the way it moved. It seemed to have tremendous trouble walking while on its back legs and eventually it dropped on all fours. That's when it picked up tremendous speed. I panicked and ran inside, slamming the door behind me. When I looked out of the window it was gone.* \\n\\n*Like I said, initially my parents did not believe me. They told me no amount of imaginary monsters would get me home, so I better just get used to it. Yeah.* \\n\\n*For a bit I could barely sleep at night, and usually I would keep crying to my parents until they let me sleep in bed with them. Though, after a couple of days of nothing happening I figured that maybe I really HAD imagined it and I tried sleeping in my own bed again. And everything did seem fine at first.*  \\n\\n*However, in the dead of night, I suddenly woke up from a rattling sound. A feeling of dread filled me promptly. I opened my eyes and I saw a pair of eyes staring right back at me. This black creepy person was hanging from the ceiling. I couldn’t make out that much in the dark, but its grey eyes and pointy white teeth were crystal clear. I lay there completely terrified for a few seconds, before my instincts kicked in and I started screaming like a banshee. Almost directly the thing let go from the ceiling and dropped right on top of me. It grabbed my upper arms and squeezed me so tight I couldn't breathe. I tried to scream but there was just no more air in my lungs. I can still recall its stomach-churning face as if it were yesterday. Its eyes were so cold and clouded, almost like those of a dead person. Its skin was dry and hard. It seemed to be stretched so tight that it couldn't close its mouth completely, leaving it slightly opened, almost smiling, but not quite. Then, it dug into me. I could feel its sharp teeth break the skin of my neck and the warm wet blood soaking my pajamas. As its grasp released I cried out in agony. That's when my father barged through the door.*  \\n\\n*The next thing I remember is being in the hospital. I'd had to get stitches for the wound in my neck.*  \\n\\n*My father had apparently shot the thing with the handgun he kept in the nightstand. It had immediately fled through the window.* \\n\\n*My father insisted that my mother and I leave pronto, while he stayed to figure out what that thing was. My mother wouldn't have any of it initially, but he must have somehow convinced her, because the last thing I remember from that week is waving my dad goodbye from the backseat of our Volvo.* \\n\\n*When my father came home two weeks later he was different in a way that I could never really grasp. He refused to talk about it after that.* \\n\\n*In the spring of '86 my parents got a divorce. Me and my mom stayed in our house in the suburbs, while my father moved to the holiday home. They had shared custody, so most weekends, at least for the first few years, I was with my dad.*  \\n\\n*The first day back in there my dad sat me down to talk about the thing I saw in '84. He said there was a lot more than one of them, he called them \"Lurkers\". Fortunately, they were mostly, if not altogether, gone by now. Regardless, there were a few things to keep in mind, he said.*  \\n\\n*1. Don't go in the basement.*  \\n\\n*2. If you really have to go in the basement, NEVER OPEN THE HATCH. (Sorry guys...)*\\n \\n*3. Never go out in the dark without a gun.* \\n \\n*4. Never go anywhere without a flashlight.* \\n\\n \\n*He still wouldn't tell me much about them, so the few things I cán tell you about the \"lurkers\" are these:*  \\n\\n*They're practically immortal. My dad said that, as far as he knew, literally nothing kills them.Their skin is very tough to break, bullets will not penetrate. As far as that goes, guns are pretty much useless.* \\n\\n*They're also practically blind. In the dark they cán see, but only barely and if you stand very still they can't really tell you from the background anymore. Any kind of light blinds them completely. This is why you should always carry a flashlight. They avoid light like the plague, so it's a great way to deter them IF they haven't noticed you. If they have, however, heard you or seen you already, light won't be enough to scare it off anymore.*\\n \\n*Because of the blindness they operate on hearing. Their hearing is extremely well developed so you'd need to be completely still not to be heard by them. This, however, is where a gun comes in handy. If you're familiar with guns, you'll also be familiar with the impact of a gunshot on an unprotected ear. Firing a gun will leave them temporarily deafened and therefore defenseless. I imagine that is how my dad managed to capture them all.* \\n\\n*I say 'them áll' because after the summer of '84 I have never seen one again. My dad never outright told me they were locked in the basement, but I have heard the rattling sound coming from there often enough that I know for sure they were.* \\n\\n*As far as where they come from, the what or why, or how, I don't know. I know nothing. My father was very secretive about it.*\\n\\n*My dad and I got estranged later on and I actually hadn't talked to him in years before he died. I don't know what he has been up to. However, I do have most of his possessions in my attic so maybe I can find something there that will give you an idea of what to do. Right now, though, I don't know anything or anyone that could help you.* \\n \\n*I apologize that this got so long-winded, I fear it's still only the tip of the iceberg. Here's my number: xxxxxxxxxx, call or email me if you need anything, I will get back to you as soon as I find something.* \\n\\n*Please be safe,*\\n\\n*William.* \\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nInitially I was rather pissed that he just sold us the house knowing all this and I was about to give this guy a piece of my mind, but Chris talked me out of it. Seeing as we still kind of need whatever information he has buried in his attic, it's best not to burn any bridges. I shot back a short email, thanking him for reaching out and telling him we really would like to hear more. \\n\\nWhat Chris had told me earlier seemed to be correct, there was definitely more than one. But that only made us wonder, how many more?  \\n\\nThat night Chris and I were really, really scared. We got up to the bedroom, barricaded the door and slept with the lights on, only after checking every nook and cranny of the room.  \\n\\nWhen the sun finally came up we went through the house systematically, in an effort to make sure there were no 'lurkers' left. Luckily, there weren't any, save for the ones we locked in the basement already. And William was right, if you listen closely when it's really quiet, you can hear them sometimes. Pretty freaky. \\n\\nAfter the swoop of the house, we locked all the windows and kept all the doors shut except for going in and out. It was still pretty scary at times, but we'd acquired a certain sense of safety in our little fortress.  \\n\\nIt wasn't until Monday night that we finally heard back from William. This time it was just a text.  \\n\\n------------------------------ \\n*Hello!*  \\n\\n*I hope you're doing okay. I found some interesting things that I reckon will be useful to you both. I'm driving over to your place tomorrow. I'll be there around dinner time.* \\n \\n*See you soon,* \\n\\n*William.* \\n\\n------------------------------ \\n \\nGreat! Right? Except for he never showed. At six he left a message, saying he was in traffic. Then at eight, he still wasn't there. We tried calling but we kept getting his voicemail. We started to get increasingly worried and at about eleven we decided to call the cops. They said there wasn't much they could do at this point, though. The night came and went and we still can't reach him. Chris is about to go the police station, to see if that will get us anywhere. We called the realtor this morning and explained the situation in hopes that he might be able to reach someone closer to William, but so far we haven't heard back from him. \\n\\nI’m really torn, who knows, maybe William never had any intention of coming over. Or maybe he changed his mind. I hope he's alright though. \\n\\nI'll let you all know if anything changes. If anyone has any suggestions, I'm open to anything. Especially in the long term, we are just so screwed. At this point I kind of just want to torch the place. Ah, well.  \\n\\nSee you soon, Reddit.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>I had started dating online- I decided the chance of meeting my soul mate at a bar or on the street was a one in a million chance, but online at least expanded my horizon. A man who lived nearby who seemed relatively nice offered to go on a date at a restaurant nearby. I agreed. I packed my things into a satchel and was on my way.\\n\\nThe date was nice and he was very polite. Even though I insisted, he still payed for dinner. Everything was going swell- he was walking me home, chatting with me. Then my phone vibrated- I had a text. I ignored it, I was having a good time, I didn't want to seem rude and whip out my phone.\\n\\nWhen we arrived to my apartment, I invited him in for some tea. My phone buzzed several times as I prepared it, so I finally pulled it out to discover 5 new messages from an unknown number. \\n\"Where are you?\"\\n\"You're late.\"\\n\"Did you ditch?\"\\n\"I guess you're not showing up,\"\\n\"I'm just leaving now, okay? If something happened, call me.\"\\n\\nI was confused at first, so I went to the bathroom and sat on the rim of the bathtub and responded, \"Who are you? What are you talking about?\" Nearly a minute later, I got a response. \"I'm xxxx xxxxxx, remember? The guy you promised to meet at a restaurant?\" I was petrified. I heard a knock on the bathroom door. \"Hey, you okay?\" the man in my apartment said.\\n\\nWho was he? How did he know about the date?\\nI called 911 emergency.

       "      <td>I just recently came home for the summer, and tonight my parents are out so I'm alone in the house for the first time in weeks. I've been lying in my bed for an hour or so waiting for sleep to come, but of course it doesn't. I spend far too much time on r/nosleep for that to be an easy task, I guess. So a text from my boyfriend (let's call him Charlie), who I haven't seen in a month, was a welcome distraction from the tedium of being too-awake-to-sleep, too-tired-to-turn-on-light. Our conversation goes like this:\\n\\nCharlie: \"Hello beutiful\"\\n\\nNo kisses, unusual, but I don't tend to read into things too much.\\n\\nMe: \"Hey baby! How are you doing? xxx\"\\n\\nC: \"It's good to see you again\"\\n\\nNow as I mentioned, I haven't seen him in a month. But I am seeing him- FINALLY- on Monday, so I just assume he's drunk or high and made a typo. Easily done, right?\\n\\nM: \"Well yeah, it will be. What are you up to? xxx\"\\n\\nC: \"Im horny. i want you. Bitch.\"\\n\\nThat's a little weird. It's not as though we never exchange sexual messages, but he never calls me bitch. Not in that context, at least. And then it hits me. Charlie lost his phone last week, blackout drunk and stupid. He doesn't have a new one yet, as far as I'm aware, so now I'm a little weirded out. So I call him.\\n\\nAnd I hear a ringtone.\\n\\nAnd it's coming from outside my bedroom door.\\n\\n**UPDATE:** Barricading myself in my room. This is awful.\\n\\n**UPDATE TWO:** MY FUCKING POWER IS OUT. THIS IS NOT A FUCKING JOKE. MY PHONE DIED AND MY POWER IS OUT.\\n\\n[part two] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k4xns/texts_from_my_boyfriend_update/)</td>\n",

       "      <td>A little over two weeks ago, my girlfriend, our two dogs and cats and I had all moved into a new construction home. It was on a short street with about 12-13 plots all for new homes being built in the area as part of some new construction groups \"test run.\" Because of this, the homes were lavish, at least to our standards, and cheaper than most other homes of half the quality. At first the price shocked us, but given that we'd been crammed into a 2 bedroom, 900 square ft home with all 4 animals and ourselves with next to no storage space, we were willing to take a plunge and move out to just about anywhere. The new home was about 1,800 square ft, had 3 bedrooms and a bonus room, a backyard big enough for the pups to run around in and enjoy, and most importantly, no neighbors, at least not yet which meant things would be quite. Our last house had been about 2 miles away from the airport and highway, which meant any time of the day we were hearing planes landing and taking off, and 60 mile an hour traffic. Our dogs liked to bark at just about anything, including their shadows and now the only thing we had to worry about was builders in the lots next to ours for the next couple months to finish the new homes, and that was a given when we moved in and something we could handle considering the cost of the home. \\n\\nThe builder met with us personally, laid out his construction plan and assured us the other homes would fill the remaining plots in the next 4-5 months, and since we'd have to deal with the racket, he'd personally cover our HOA fees, make sure his landscapers kept our lawn trimmed, and even gave us the first installation package of a new home security system that just hit the market. I was thrilled about the home security, in large part of past issues I've had with several different break ins. I wasn't taking any chances, and so I made sure I was an expert on the system by the time the realtor left the keys with us on day one. It had one of those robotic voices, you know where it announces, \"front door open,\" or \"garage door open,\" I think you get the picture. A small price to pay for knowing which entry and exit point was being used at any point in time. Of course, like any home security system, the actual alarm that went off was louder than most school fire alarms. I was impressed really. The first few times my girlfriend came home she'd forgotten that it was set and the police stopped by more than once to have a laugh with us about it. They understood the whole new construction thing, new house, new bells and whistles, etc. To top everything off, I could access the alarm system from an app on my phone which made me even more secure, knowing that if we ever left the house and animals unguarded and weren't sure if we'd plugged in the alarm code, I could easily access it from anywhere and make sure things were secure. Here's where things get interesting though, the company behind the alarm system, they were called ZenTeke Security. I hadn't thought of it at first, but aside from the small wire flag in the corner or the front yard and an emblem of ZTS, I couldn't find any actual reference online to them. I searched for a website, a phone number, anything to help in case I ever forgot how to use a certain feature on the system or had to reset the code and couldn't figure it out myself. I got ahold of the home builder one day on my way out the door and he just said that they were relatively unknown still, and so they were still getting everything set up, a web base, direct line, etc. He said they were local, and gave me an address if I ever wanted to go down there, but being on the verge of a final at work for being late, I stuffed the address in my pocket and forgot about it. Any who, moving on to today, and this is where the weird shit started happening. \\n\\nI worked early because of overtime and so I left the house around 8:30am when I usually work the swing shift and don't start until 11am. My girlfriend usually has class on Wednesdays from 1pm-4:30 and then works a few hours at her colleges student union building. She gets home around 7-7:30 and usually we run into each other since it's the same time I'm usually off work. Tonight though, I beat her home and she had worse luck with traffic coming from the opposite side of town. Walking into the new house, I immediately noticed something was off. The dogs hadn't bombarded me through the door like they usually do when we walk in. Instead, I peered from the entry way through the kitchen to the back door and noticed them running around in the backyard. First off, the dogs can't be left outside all day while we're gone because they bark at anything including their shadow. We hadn't wanted ot leave them out to annoy the builders during the day so we'd been keeping them inside. Secondly, the blinds to the backdoor were open, and I always have them closed for privacy, and that went for any blinds in the house. Even living in a new home, my girlfriends still home for part of the days and I don't need any sweaty builders looking to take a break and play peeping tom while my girlfriend roams the house. The last thing that was off, and something I hadn't noticed until I'd taken a few steps into the house was that the floor vents, at least the one right inside the front door entry way and in the living room next to the fire place were flipped open. The new house had hardwood floors and so any air coming out of the vents made for quite an eerie sound. A few more steps inside and the cats came blasting out of the master bedroom. We'd made it clear when we moved in that the cats weren't allowed in there when no one was home because they were still figuring out the new space, and we didn't want them shitting under out bed. My girlfriend was always good about keeping them out when she left for class, and I was never here during the day unless it was Thursday or Friday for my days off. I closed the front door behind me to keep the cats from getting out, and took a quick peak around the house. Call me paranoid, but I even checked the crawl space, the trash cans in the garage and underneath the counter tops to see if someone was by chance, stowed away inside my house. Then it dawned on me, the alarm system hadn't gone off when I came inside. \\n\\nNo \"front door open,\" no \"garage door open,\" and no small chime to remind me to plug in the code and disarm it. I walked back to the entry way where the alarm panel was and woke the touch display. The system read \"armed - silent - delayed - error - call admin.\" I pressed a few more buttons trying to navigate away from the error but nothing on the screen was responding. Just then, my girlfriend came through the door and the alarm went blaring off, full volume and no matter what I pressed on the alarm panel, it wouldn't shut off. The dogs started barking, the cats when crazy and started hissing at the dogs, and my girlfriend and I had our hands covering our ears. Not thinking straight enough thanks to the piercing noise, I bashed my fist against the screen. The noise continued, but the display shut off. My girlfriend motioned to the garage, and went out to flip the breakers. The noise finally stopped a few moments later, but now we had a house without power. We flipped the breakers back over to give the house power, but the alarm came back on. It's been a couple hours now, and it's well passed 9pm. We can't get ahold of the builder to ask him about the alarm system and the crumpled up address in my pocket has bled and smeared on the paper he wrote the it on. We're currently sitting upstairs in our bonus room with a few candles, the pups and the cats, and I just finished sharing everything that happened and what I saw when I first came home, and needless to say, my girlfriend and I are a bit spooked. Thankfully, the one box we have with candles was throw up here since we haven't finished unpacking the miscellaneous shit, and the bonus room has a balcony for me to smoke from. My apologies for any spelling mistakes or grammar, as I've written most of this from my iPhone, and chain smoking cigarettes. As ridiculous as it sounds, we're both a bit too antsy to go downstairs and continue checking things out, and I have a gut feeling we shouldn't leave the bonus room. I'll update tomorrow as soon we get ahold of the builder and hopefully we get things sorted out with the alarm system and weird shit stops happening. \\n\\nOne last thing though, and if anyone else can maybe shed some light on this as home owners too, there's a section of the ceiling in the bonus room that can be lifted up to go into the attic area of the house. Are they supposed to be locked? We had one in our home before, and to my knowledge there shouldn't be a lock on them. I just noticed too that there looks to be a few paint shavings and bits of insulation on the ground beneath it where my girlfriend and I have been sitting, so I know it's been opened before, but there's no way to open it now. We haven't spent a whole lot of time up here since moving in, so maybe the paint chips and insulation have been here all along? Maybe the attics blocked from the inside by a piece of wood that was cut too long in the frame of the house.. I'm just throwing out ideas to make myself feel better I guess. If anyone has better ideas, outside of destroying the ceiling to my house so I can get it open to find out, I'm up for suggestions. \\n\\n-- \\n\\n\\n[Update]: \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I managed to nut up and go downstairs, let the dogs out to piss and searched things pretty well through with a couple flashlights we had stuffed in our \"junk drawer.\" Nothing else seemed out of place aside from the few things I listed above, and she assured me that she had left the blinds closed and the bedroom locked up when she left for class earlier in the day. We secured all the doors and windows, made sure everything was locked up and moved ourselves to the master bedroom, dogs, cats, all of us. We lit some more candles and made sure we even kept a chair against the bedroom door and managed to get some sleep. Aside from the cats playing around all night and knocking some shit off the dresser, the night was relatively normal. \\n\\nWoke up this morning to the dogs barking and the sound of construction next door, and so I got dressed and scoped around outside to find the builder. I saw his truck down the road in front of one of the empty plots, and this was around 8am. He was sitting in the front seat, talking on his phone and yelling at someone, maybe an ex wife or girlfriend. I only say that because I heard something along the lines of, \"you can't keep me from seeing them,\" a few derogatory terms and finally it ended with \"I don't have the child support.\" That's when he saw me approaching his truck. \\n\\nHe quickly changed his tone and greeted me, and I went into what happened with the alarm, not having power all night and wanting to get in touch with the alarm company. He came over, flipped our breakers and all our lights came back on, but no alarm. He opened the front door, and sure as shit, \"front door open.\" I asked him to write down the companies address again and this time I made sure to copy it onto my phone so I wouldn't have to worry about losing it. I didn't mention anything else, I thought that info was better kept to ourselves until we had some more information, and I really wasn't interested in having him in our house any longer than necessary. I just kept getting a bad vibe. My girlfriend still had class today, so I was left with the animals and my thoughts to keep my company, so I made a call to have the locks changed, but they can't come by until later this evening. I scoped the address on google maps and found an empty plot of land. Fancy that, right? Just a vacant block, right between two businesses on the other side of town and on the street view, I could see a sign that even read \"for lease - call (xxx-xxx-xxxx).\" \\n\\nAt this point, I don't have a whole lot else to go on so I'm making a trip to homedepot to invest in some better tools so hopefully get the attic access opened up, and see if maybe anything is up there, or at least any trace of someone recently being there. \\n\\nI'll keep you guys updated as soon as I have more to go off of, and thanks for the advice so far. \\n\\n[Update as of 5/29-5/30](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/26vtyv/update_i_came_home_today_and_someone_else_has/)</td>\n",

       "      <td>I live on the East Coast, where doesn’t matter. What does is that I live in an area that has the occasional Nor’Easter. For those not in the United States, a Nor’Easter is a major blizzard, which happens in the the northeast (New York, Massachusetts, Maine, etc) But, we haven’t quite gotten one in a while, matter of fact in the time I’ve been alive.  We had a big blizzard the day I was born, Valentine’s Day, but other than that nothing too serious. \\n\\nThat day started out good. I was a straight A student halfway through my first year of high school and I had some really great friends. I was currently , wearing better clothes and looking good. (I was planning on going on a date later that night and wanted to make sure I would look good). Satisfied I changed into school clothes. It wasn’t until I saw the worried look of my mom as I entered the kitchen that I knew something was up. \\n\\n“Listen to this,” she told me, holding out her phone. As she did mine went off. \\n\\n“*All residents of xxx counties and surrounding areas, stay sheltered, we have a major storm warning, I repeat, we have a major storm coming your way. Make sure you have food and water, and a backup generator running. Schools will be closed and get home from work or school*,” Cool I thought. My first Nor’Easter, plus a snow day. Until I heard the odd part of the broadcast, “*Barricade, lock, do whatever you need to do to keep anything out*” \\n\\nOdd, but maybe the they’re worried over trees crashing down? I texted my girlfriend and asked if her family had a generator. She said no, and my parents were friends with her parents so we had them over.\\n\\nAnd then there was more, “*do not undo your locks or barricades if anyone requests to stay during the storms wrath.*” I glanced sideways at my mom who told me dad was on his way home from work, and that the storm was 20 minutes out. We brought everything downstairs in a cellar, accessible with one key we keep hidden. You couldn’t enter without due to the complicated lock system. \\n\\nMy dad arrived shortly followed by my girlfriend and her family about 5 minutes after. We hunkered down, with a crap ton of food, and some games, along with my Xbox and hers (why not, we’ll be here for a while and we have power) combined they were loaded with Fallout 4, Rainbow Six, My girlfriend and I are plat 2, Skyrim, Forza, Halo, and prepared for the long haul. It was almost like a party. Then we heard it. The pelting of hail, and then hard, fast winds. Thinking nothing of it I we ditched the Xbox to play blackjack (we were betting Cheez-Itz and it got pretty serious). \\n\\nAround 11:30, about four hours later, I decided to peep through the cracks of the cellar. And I saw well, *it*. It was a weird black creature. Like a shadow sort of. It looked over my way, but not at me thank god, and I saw it’s face, or what should of been a face. Instead of a face, there were two slits for eyes and a gaping hole for a jaw. I motioned my girlfriend over and she saw it too. We looked at each other before hearing a broadcast. \\n\\n“*Do **not** leave your shelters. The federal government has issued a broader warning area, and it seems to be getting worse*” It didn’t mention the creature. Although I do believe that’s what the government was warning about. All I could think about were the sheer amounts of government facilities that are hiding things like this. I really don’t know, and it’s scary. Then about 3 minutes later I heard it. Footsteps above our cellar. My dog Luna, a beautiful black lab had her fur up, snarling. She never does that. I shushed her and motioned for no one to move. My dad grabbed the rifle we have, and shouldered it. My poor cat was under the tv stand, hair up, eyes wide. \\n\\nIt’s been three hours. The creature has pleaded to be let it in, mimicking my aunt. It crushed me to hear it, but I knew it wasn’t her. They were in Florida with my cousins. Then it let out a horrible wail, sort of a scream, like a mother who lost their child. Then they were gone. The storm continued. \\n\\nPlease if anyone knows what’s going on help. Please.</td>\n",

I don’t like where this is going. Some of your theories are pretty wild (well done), and I don’t know how much of it I even want to document going forward. The support is appreciated. \\n\\n\\nI fell asleep in my car Thursday night after my first post, I was pretty shaken up. When I woke up Friday morning (yesterday) I had dozens of missed calls and texts. A vast majority of them were from Stacy, and she was not happy. She saw me asleep in my car in the morning when she left to take the kids to school. She thought I was drunk from the reunion, and fell asleep in the car. I feel like I really dodged a bullet there, as it bought me a little more time to think clearly before addressing this head on. I know a lot of you recommended I bring it to light immediately, but I need to investigate and come up with a game plan.\\n\\n\\nThere was one text in particular that caught my attention – it was from a number I didn’t recognize:\\n\\n\\n**619-xxx-xxxx:** *Why did you run off so fast last night? There’s something I need to talk to you about, and it’s important. Can we talk?*\\n\\n\\n**I didn’t respond – I’m feeling like I need to be very careful with what I do next**\\n\\n\\nAnyway, I got my shit together and went to work Friday (yesterday), but obviously got nothing done. The only reason I actually went is because I thought the normalcy would help to preserve my sanity throughout the shit storm I was about to endure. \\n\\n\\nI called a couple of my friends that were at the reunion (there aren’t many that I’m actually friends friends with). I nonchalantly asked if they saw Stacy – being careful not to specify which Stacy. Nobody saw her – they asked if we were having issues at home and why I wouldn’t have known if my wife was there / who was watching the kids… etc. So, that was no help. \\n\\n\\nAs kind of an aside, it sounds like there was a bit of commotion at the reunion around somebody that showed up that wasn’t on the original guest list. In fact, her name wasn’t listed in the year book either when they checked – her name was Beth (fyi, I switched this name too for anonymity). She insisted that she had graduated with our class, so they let her in and didn’t put up too much of a fight (especially because so few people from our class actually showed up). Doesn’t sound like she hung around long though. \\n\\n\\nThe calls and texts continued to roll in from my wife, Stacy, throughout the day, and I ignored them. I realized I had three options:\\n\\n\\n**A.)** Bail. This would mean leaving my kids behind. Obviously not really an option at all, as I don’t think there is such a thing as life for me without my kids. \\n\\n \\n**B.)** Confront her in some way – share what I’m going through / explain everything.\\n\\n\\n**C.)** Play it all off until I can gather more info to make a solid decision.\\n\\n\\nI’m going with C. If I don’t rock the boat, I’ll be able to coast a little longer without any permanent impact on my life. That is unless my wife has knowledge beyond what I know or has plans to kill me. If she’s logical in any way still, I don’t think this is a real threat. If it is, then I have to give her kudos because she has moved mountains, and stars have aligned to pull this thing off. \\n\\n\\nSince I’m rolling with the path of least resistance – I decided it would be best to go with the story that she already believed to be true. This would mean telling her that I drank too much at the reunion. One drink lead to several, I drove home like an asshole, and I fell asleep in my car. We all know that this is not what happened (and I don’t condone drinking and driving) but it seemed like it was easier to go with this than it would be to make up another story and sell her on it. \\n\\n\\nWhen I got home, she had dinner ready like she normally does. She and I spoke briefly about everything in private, and I confirmed what happened the night before / why I was in the car. She was disappointed, I pretended to be ashamed and embarrassed, all was okayish. \\n\\n\\nWhen we sat down for dinner with the kids, she asked me a little more about the actual reunion. I played it cool, and told the story exactly as it happened – everything up until the piece where Stacy tapped me on the shoulder at the reunion. It’ll be much easier to keep all of this straight if I keep it as close to the truth as possible. I have no idea what she knows, I have no idea if there are others involved or what. So, I want to minimize the opportunities for getting caught in a lie. \\n\\n\\nI’m getting the impression that she doesn’t really think anything is up. I’m pretty good at staying cool under pressure; however, I am a bit nervous. Based on her responses and body language, I suspect that she probably wrote it off in her own mind as a result of the drinking and driving incident (i.e. me feeling ashamed/embarrassed). \\n\\n\\nThis is good – things are kind of coasting along, and it feels like I can ride this out and keep digging as long as I’m careful. \\n\\n\\nI went to bed shortly after dinner. I obviously didn’t sleep well in the car, and things were still a bit hazy so I felt like this was best. \\n\\n\\nThis brings us to today. So, I woke up this morning, and felt pretty good about everything. I feel normal. If I wanted I could legitimately pretend like I never saw Stacy at the reunion, and I think life would continue on as it did beforehand. At least, that’s the vibe I’m getting from everyone around me (nobody close to me is really asking weird questions). \\nThat said – I’m going to dig because I want to know more. I went ahead and finally responded to that text this morning…\\n\\n\\n**619-xxx-xxxx:** *Why did you run off so fast last night? There’s something I need to talk to you about, and it’s important. Can we talk?*\\n\\n\\n**Me:** *Hey, what do you mean? Who is this?*\\n\\n\\n**I figured it would be better to play dumb and fish for information before divulging anything that could be potentially damaging to my situation.**\\n\\n\\nI’m still waiting on the reply now. I have no idea what happens from here. If they don’t respond, maybe I just go back to living life the way I was and forget any of this ever happened.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7ptkdg/i_ran_into_my_high_school_sweetheart_tonight_at/?ref=share&amp;\\n\\n[Part 2 - you are here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7q6bgt/i_ran_into_my_high_school_sweetheart_tonight_at/?ref=share&amp;</td>\n",

I hope you all understand.\\n\\n\\nI’m scared.  I’ve watched scary movies and read scary stories my entire life, but nothing compares to the real thing.  The way your stomach bottoms out or your hands tremble.  The way your mind goes quiet and you become paralyzed.  The moment when you think that you are about to die.  That’s real fear.  And that fear has nothing on the way your heart races when something makes you jump in a movie.  Because this is real. \\n\\n\\nLet me rewind a bit, and I’ll go ahead and apologize if this is too long.  If it is, you don’t have to read it, just knowing that it’s out there and someone may read it comforts me enough. \\nI just moved into a new apartment about a month ago with my two best friends for my senior year of college.  Let’s call them Becky and Gary.  I stayed in my hometown and commuted to a small university for my college career, and I finally decided I needed to get out on my own.  \\n\\n\\nWhen we were moving, we all joked about how unfortunate it would be if we moved into a haunted apartment.  We all spent the first few weeks semi-paranoid.  We would hear noises in the night, but we ultimately chalked it up to our noisy upstairs neighbors and our nocturnal cats.  Either way, I was generally uneasy most of that time.  Staying up at night reading [r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/) stories didn’t help much either.\\n\\n\\nOne day Becky came home from work.  We both waitressed at a local Italian place, but I was off that night.  She was creeped out and explained to us about a strange man she had at her table.  This man knew a little too much about Becky.  He knew her height and weight, her birthday, her astrological sign, and he kept trying to get her to meet him later.  We thought it was weird, but we popped open a bottle of wine and laughed about it.  We figured it was a coincidence.\\n\\n\\nBut a couple nights ago I got a strange message.  Becky was at work, and I was at home doing homework when my phone buzzed.  I looked at it, and it was from a number I didn’t know:\\n\\n\\nxxx-xxx-xxxx: *Are your doors locked?*\\n\\n\\nI had just updated my phone, and when my phone restarts none of my contacts are registered for a few minutes.  I just figured this was my mom.  She was always telling me to lock my doors (she spends a lot of time watching Investigation Discovery).  And yes, I’m ashamed to admit that I rely a little too much on technology and I don’t have my mom’s number memorized.  I got out of bed and went to check my front door, and it was locked.  I texted back to say yes, and the response was immediate:\\n\\n\\nxxx-xxx-xxxx: *How Aquarius of you to check.*\\n\\n\\nMy blood ran cold.  My mom didn’t know anything about astrology.  I didn’t know what to do.  I thought about calling to police, but I decided against it.  We had told all of our friends about Becky’s weird experience at work, so I just figured it was one of them messing with me.  So I texted back.  This is the exchange between me and the unknown number.\\n\\n\\nMe: *Lol, is this Janice?*\\n\\n\\nX: *You might want to tell your friend to be careful walking to her car tonight.*\\n\\n\\nMe: *This really isn’t funny.  Who is this?*\\n\\n\\nX: *I’m not laughing*\\n\\n\\nMe: *I’m calling the police*\\n\\n\\nX: *Good luck.*\\n\\n\\nIf it was just a joke, the threat of police would have made one of my friends fess up.  I paced around my living room, trembling.  I didn’t know what to do.  If I was reading or watching this, I would be screaming at the character to stop being stupid and just call the police!  It wouldn’t hurt even if it was just a prank.  But I realized in that moment that it’s a lot different when it’s real life.  When it’s your life.\\n\\n\\nI jumped when I heard a key turning in the lock.  Becky opened the door.  She looked white as a sheet.  She slammed the door behind her and locked the door.  She leaned against the door and looked at me.  Tears were shining in her eyes.\\n\\n\\n“Why are you home so early?” I asked.  It was only 8.  She shouldn’t have been home for another couple hours.\\n\\n\\n“A random number texted me.”\\n\\n\\nMy heart was racing.  “What did they say?”  She shook her head and just handed me her phone.  My stomach sank as I read the text message:\\n\\n\\n*Be careful not to slip on your roommate’s blood when you walk in.*\\n\\n\\nWe didn’t know what to think. We wanted to believe it was just a sick joke, but it didn’t make the fear any less real.  We slept together in my room that night.  Becky had fallen asleep, and I was still up watching Law and Order.  I noticed my blinds were raised slightly, so I got up to close them.  I was still getting used to the new apartment, so I accidentally pulled them the wrong way, causing the blinds to raise.  I quickly shut them, but not before I saw what I swore was a person standing at the edge of the trees.  Looking right at me.\\n\\n\\nThe next few days passed without incident.  I would have thought it was only just a dream if I didn’t have Becky to verify the events.  But, still, the past few day have been quiet, and I think we were starting to believe that we were safe.  Maybe it was just a joke.  It wasn’t until today that I have realized how sick this person really is.\\n\\n\\nI went to my mom’s house to watch the football games.  We were broke college kids who didn’t want to pay for cable, so I spent every Saturday that I wasn’t at work at my mom’ house, taking advantage of her all-access cable.  My team’s game came on around 7, so I was at her house until about 11 at night.  She wasn’t there because she worked nights, all of my siblings moved away years ago, and Becky was at work.  So, I was alone with some wings enjoying the game.\\n\\n\\nAround 9 o’clock I started to hear what sounded like a growling.  I paused the TV, and it stopped just seconds after.  I was sitting in a recliner right next to the sliding glass doors leading to the backyard.  One of the doors was covered with blinds, but the other door was not.  The blinds had fallen about a year ago, and we never got around to replacing them.  I looked out the door, but I didn’t see anything.  I chalked it up to being my neighbor’s dog, and got on with my football game.\\n\\n\\nBut it kept happening.  Every time I would pause the TV, it would stop.  It wasn’t coming from the TV, but I didn’t know what it was.  Within the next 10 or so minutes, it sounded like the growling was coming from both the front and the back yard.  I chose to just ignore it, turning up the volume, and eventually, it went away.\\n\\n\\nI left as soon as the game ended, and my team had won, so I was euphoric.  When I got outside to my car, I noticed a piece of paper stuck under my windshield wiper.  My neighbors frequently left me notes on my car when I was visiting, as not to bother me, saying how they missed me and hoped I was doing well and if I needed anything etc., so I didn’t think this was weird.  I grabbed the piece of paper and got into my car. I opened the note to see which neighbor it was from.  My blood started pounding in my ears as I read the note:\\n\\n\\n*Are you scared yet?*\\n\\n\\nIt only took a few seconds for my fear to transform into anger.  I didn’t take lightly to someone trying to bully me into feeling scared.  I started to consider all of this less sinister, and think of it more of just a prick trying to get a rise out of two young girls.  I crumpled the note and threw it to my floorboard.\\n\\n\\nWhen I got back home, Becky still wasn’t home from work.  I milled about in the living room for a while.  I ate a hot pocket and watched an episode of Dawson’s Creek.  I tried waiting up, but it was becoming harder and harder to keep my eyes open.  Becky finally texted me around 12:30 and said she had gotten off but was going to grab her shift beer.  She invited me, but I was too tired to go.  I told her to come in my room and let me know when she got home.\\n\\n\\nWhen I walked into my room, my bed was made.  I’m not someone who usually makes their bed, but if my door is open, and Becky sees it, she will usually make it for me.  My room was spotless actually.  I needed to remember to thank Becky when she got home.  There was a piece of paper on my pillow, and I sat down, eager to read a sweet note from my friend.\\n\\n\\n*What about now?*\\n\\n\\nI threw the note on my nightstand with trembling hands.  Had this person been in my apartment?  Had he been in my room?  I quickly checked under my bed and in my closet, but I was comforted to find that no one else was in the room.  I quickly texted Becky to thank her for making my bed.\\n\\n\\nShe texted back immediately: “Lol I didn’t.  But you’re welcome!”\\n\\n\\nI was finding it hard to breathe.  I responded that it must have been our other roommate, but I knew that it wasn’t.  I laid down, in tears, wondering why this was happening to us.  I was surprised to open my eyes to daylight.  It felt like only a few minutes had passed, but I guess I had fallen asleep.  \\n\\n\\nI went into the living room, and there was no sign of anyone up.  Weird.  Becky was always up before me.  I walked to her room and knocked on the door.  No answer.  I opened the door, and she wasn’t there.  Her bed was still made, and her fairy lights were still on from the night before.  I checked my phone to see if she had gone to the store or on a run.  I had two texts from her but they were both from the night before.\\n\\n\\n*12:57 A.M. - On the way home, bub*\\n\\n\\n*1:05 A.M. - He is herhuy769o8293*\\n\\n\\nI don’t think Becky ever made it home last night.\\n\\n\\nIf anyone out there is reading this, I'll update you if I can.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: for grammar</td>\n",

       "      <td>It’s been three days since it happened. My hands are finally steady enough to type my story out. The police officers involved in this case were kind enough to allow me to type out my testimony. I don’t think I could retell the story in a court room, not with her there. I’m also not sure if it’s illegal or not to share this online, but I’m doing it. If there is any way that I can prevent this from happening again, to protect anyone from experiencing what I saw, I’d happily take the risk.\\n\\nI may as well start from the beginning:\\n\\nI’m a VERY broke college student and any easy money opportunities are few and far between. I was off for the summer at home and looking for odd jobs. One day, I received a letter in the mail box. There was no return address, just a stamp, my name, and my address. I sat down at the kitchen table, tearing the envelope open with an embarrassingly intense curiosity. \\n\\nA small newspaper clipping fluttered out onto the table. Checking the inside of the envelope, I was disappointed to find that there was nothing else. I picked up the clipping. It looked old and worn, like someone had spent a good amount of time sitting and rubbing it over with their thumb. On one side was a piece of an indiscernible picture. On the other was an ad, like one out of a classified listing. It was a wanted ad for a house keeper. There wasn’t much written, just that someone was needed on weekends and the pay was a decent hourly wage. On the bottom of the paper, there was a phone number. \\n\\nI sat back in my chair. I might as well call. The ad might have been old, but if it ended up in my mailbox, it’s likely that the ad poster was still searching for someone to fill the position. Looking back between my phone and the clipping, I dialed the number. \\n\\nOn the third ring, someone picked up. It was an older woman. I was almost shocked that someone answered.\\n“Hello?”\\n\\n“Uh, yes. Hello. I’m calling about the ad you put out in the paper for a house keeper?” The lady on the other end seemed to pause.\\n\\n“Ah. Oh, yes. Of course. I’m just looking for someone to watch the house while I’m away, and take care of my plants.”\\n\\n“Is the position still open?”\\n\\n“Yes, it is. How about you come over later today and I’ll explain the details?”\\n\\nI agreed and she gave me an address. It seemed like too good of an opportunity to pass up. When I arrived at her house later, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. She had a lovely white house with a long driveway lined with fir trees. It was like something out of a magazine. As I drove further up, I could see the shape of the woman bent over in a garden. I parked my car and approached her. I cleared my voice so I didn’t frighten her. She looked up and motioned for me to come forward. The lady stood and gesture to her plants. \\n\\n“This is my garden. My life’s work. It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”\\n\\nI nodded in agreement. It was beautiful. The garden seemed to wrap around one side of the house. Great tall oak trees bordered the outside with leaves that had just began to darken. Where the garden met the house, thick patches of ivy sprouted out of the ground and curled up the side and around the brick chimney. Hues of dark red speckled my view as I noticed the rose bushes. They were almost taller than me. The roses on them were breath-taking, shining in the sun-lit dew like bright rubies.\\n\\nI looked back her. “You did all this?”\\n\\n“Yes, and it takes quite a bit of work to keep it. Come, let’s go inside and I’ll tell you more.”\\n\\nI studied her as she led me in. The way she looked was strange. There was no way she was older than fifty, but the years appeared to be hard on her face and voice. Yet, at the same time, she had a large build that made me think she could throw me over her head. We sat down in a kitchen that rivaled any from Home and Garden’s. She offered me a cup of tea.\\n\\n“Now, down to business.” She said.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t usually need someone to take care of my house of plants, but unfortunately, my sister-in-law has recently passed. My brother is in no shape to handle this on his own.”\\n\\nThe woman sipped on her drink.\\n\\n“This weekend I need to drive there to go to the funeral and I need someone to watch the house. I’m sure this will not be a re-occurring thing, but who knows. I could always use the help.”\\n\\n“This is why I need someone else’s help, someone who I can count on.” She paused.\\n\\n“Can I count on you Alex?”\\n\\n“Uh… yeah, of course.” I was slightly thrown off that she already knew me, but then I settled down. She could have known my mom or anyone who knew I was open to odd jobs.\\n\\n“Um, by the way, what’s your name?” I swallowed, surprised that I had shown up to a complete stranger’s house without knowing their name.\\n\\n“Margaret. So, I take it you accept?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nMargaret told me everything that she expected to be done. She told me that if I was finished with my job, then I could do whatever I pleased as long as I stayed at the house. A few days later, Margaret called me to come house sit. By the time I arrived, she was already gone. Margaret had said she kept a spare key away in case I came at a time like this. I lifted a porcelain garden gnome near the front porch. Sure enough, a brass key sparkled back up at me. \\n\\nThe inside of the house was darkened from the overcast outside, but with a flick of the wrist the house was bathed in a warm glow. I got to work, setting up the sprinkler system and various plant foods. I walked back out into the garden, still amazed by the roses. I chuckled as the Alice and Wonderland stories came to mind. It was only a matter of time before my chores were finished. When I returned inside, I wondered if there was something else that needed done. If I did nothing else that night, then that’s what Margaret would be paying for. \\nMost of the house was spotless, except for the kitchen counter and sink. Since I wanted to impress Margaret, I scrubbed the counter and sprayed some cleaner into the sink. I reached for the spray nozzle. The nozzle only came a few inches from where it sat. I pulled again, but it didn’t come out further.\\n\\nAnnoyed, I opened the cabinet under the sink. The hose wrapped itself around a pipe underneath. I reached my hand under, knocking over several cans and bottles of cleaner. Cursing under my breath, I set each one back up. The last one, however, kept falling over. I picked it up, wanting to toss it through the window, but my eyes caught the glint of small metal ring. \\n\\nMy finger wrapped itself around it. I pulled and was surprised when the whole bottom of the cabinet shifted up, sending cans of cleaner clattering onto the kitchen floor. My gaze returned to my hand. It held what I now recognized as a handle of sorts connected to what once was the cabinet floor. I gazed down at the hole that I had uncovered, gagging as the smell of mold wafted its way up. There was obviously some kind of water leakage. \\nIf I knew anything about it, mold was nothing to mess with. I sighed. I knew I couldn’t just put the cabinet floor back on and act like nothing ever happened. I pulled out my phone, calling Margaret, but my actions were interrupted by distant noise. A low moan. I looked deep into the black precipice. My heart doubled its pace in the silence after. The sound was soft and distant, and for a moment I thought it was the floor creaking or my imagination. Then, I heard it again. I wondered to myself if there was an animal stuck down there. \\n My hunch was confirmed when I recognized the stench of stale piss mixed with the smells from down below. For a moment, I sat and contemplated. The feeling of guilt surged up from within me, replacing the feeling of fear.\\nNow, I wish I would have just left, ran away. I wish I was a person who could let some stray mutt die.\\nI sighed again, dawning one of the painting masks that were now laying on the kitchen floor. Turning on my phone’s flashlight, I shined it into the hole. I discovered that it wasn’t just a hole, it looked like a tunnel that led off somewhere. Letting my feet sink into the hole. The spongy earth pushed back against my feet. I edged myself in to crawl along the floor of the tunnel. Even though claustrophobia was not usually a problem for me, the sensation of wet soil on my back made me feel like a cornered animal.\\n\\nFortunately, once I was in a few feet, the hole grew surprisingly roomy. It was almost as if it was meant for a person to go through. I wondered if this was not a hole, but instead some unfinished basement or cellar. Soon enough, I didn’t need to crawl. I wiped the black filth off my knees as I stood.\\n\\nI was now in an open space, vaguely in the shape of a small room. I looked around. The thing that caught my eye and the light of my phone was a large metal door. The only sound was my feet patting against the dirt floor as I approached the door. I pressed my ear against it and pieces of rust flaked onto my skin. From the other side, I heard the faint moans again, except this time closer. Another sound caught my ear. Mumbling and crying? A cold shock of fear rang through my body like an alarm. I wanted to leave. I wanted to run until I couldn’t and never look back, but some part of me couldn’t turn away. That same part of me urged my hand toward the door.\\nI grabbed the door handle, turning it. The metal grinding on metal let out a hideous squeal. The moans and cries from inside silenced. I creaked the door ajar, but still everything inside was quiet. A violet light leaked through the doorway, turning my white shirt a phosphorescent blue. I quickly turned off my phone flash light. Why were black lights down there? The thought turned over in my head and I only grew more confused. \\n\\nIn the dim light, I noticed something else. Cages. Tens of them along the floor, all old and rusted as the door I had come through. I stood still, when I heard nothing I turned my phone’s light back on. Behind the bars of the cages I could see eyes reflecting back at me.\\n\\nI stepped closer towards one of the cages and shined my light within. Whatever was in there tried to scurry away, but it couldn’t get far. I focused on it. It was a boy, cowering in the corner and covering his face.\\n\\n“Oh my god. A kid?” A horrible feeling settled in my stomach. I hurried to unlatch the cage. There was a large rusty padlock stopping me. Pulling out my pocket knife, I picked at the lock until it gave way. I swung open the door and motioned for him to come out. \\n\\n“Come on, let’s get you out of here.” The boy remained motionless but spoke, his voice was weak and horse.\\n\\n“I can’t, none of us can.”\\n\\n“Us?” I shined the light in the other cages. He was right, several more silhouettes were huddled in corners.\\n“Why can’t you leave?”\\n\\nThe boy only pointed towards his legs. A wave of nausea washed over me as I looked down. His legs were horribly emaciated, like those of a holocaust survivor. But the thing that made me want to vomit wasn’t his malnourished legs. Thick roots snaked around his ankles and under his skin. The roots sat under his flesh like nightmarish leeches, pulsating every few seconds. My eyes followed the roots as they lead back towards the ceiling of the large room. Near the top, the roots were covered with thorns and small red buds. I reached to pluck one off, crushing it open. Underdeveloped red petals sat in the palm of my hand. A horrible realization came to mind. \\n\\n“The rose bushes. They’re eating you.” \\n\\nThe horror of what I had saw slowly gave way to a burning anger.\\n\\n“Margaret.” The name seethed out of my teeth.\\n\\nI turned back to the boy. I opened my phone and hit record.\\n \\n“My name is Alex xxxxxx, I live at xxxxxx on xxxx street.” I turned toward the boy. “What is your name?”\\n\\n“My name is Henry.”\\n\\n“How long have you been kept here Henry?”\\n\\n“i-I don’t know. There are no clocks. There’s no sunlight. It could have been years.”\\n\\n“How... old are you?”\\n\\n“I’m nine.” I looked at his face, even with the malnutrition, I could tell that he should be about twelve or thirteen. \\n\\n“I’m sorry, I don’t know.” His voice even cracked like he was going through puberty.\\n\\nI stood up and walked around, recording the other cages. There were other kids, some much younger than Henry, some looked almost sixteen. Most of them cowered away when I approached, one sat still, face down. Part of me worried that she was dead. \\n\\nI opened my mouth to say more, but froze when I heard the sound of gravel at the end of the driveway. “Shit.” I tucked my phone away and went back to Henry. “Look, I’m going to get you out of here, all of you.” I closed the cage door and relocked it. \\n\\nI hurried to close the rusted door behind me. I glanced one more time at the cages before I scurried up the tunnel. I managed to place the bottom of the cabinet and the chemicals back in place before I heard the keys jingling in the front door. In through the door way came the not-so innocent Margaret who pulled a large suitcase behind her. I suppressed a shudder when I thought of who or what she could have put in there. \\n\\nShe looked toward me and smiled. “So, how did everything go?”\\n\\nI put on the best fake smile I could manage. “Everything went well, I got the plants watered and everything like you asked. Besides that, nothing else really happened.”\\n\\nMargaret looked down at my knees. “What happened to your pants dear?”\\n\\nMy heart skipped a beat as I thought of an excuse. “There was some crab grass sprouts growing around one of the rose bushes, so I pulled them out. I did it after I watered the rose bushes, so my pants got a little muddy.”\\n“Oh? Well you didn’t have to ruin your pants for me, but I appreciate the effort. Maybe you can help me in the future? It would be nice to go out more often, get the little things I need.”\\n\\n“Of course.” I lie through my teeth. In reality, I’d never wanted anything more than to be away from her. I grab what I had brought with me and began to leave.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t think you’re leaving now.” \\n\\nCold sweat builds on my forehead as I tried to think of a response. Without turning around, I responded. “What?”\\n\\n“I forgot to give you your check, silly.” She took her time getting her check book and writing a check. Seconds turned to hours, but she eventually handed me the check. At that moment, it was nothing more than a piece of paper to me. I turned to leave, and that time she didn’t stop me.\\n\\nMy car flew down the driveway, sending sticks and bits of gravel into the wind behind me. I drove as fast as I could to the nearest police station. I was greeted by a brunette police officer with a tired look in her eyes. But, by the time I was done talking to her, and she had seen the video, the officer seemed a bit more awake. I excluded the part about the roots, in case she thought this was some prank. \\n\\nWithin half an hour, a whole group of police officers had arrived at the station to question me. I told them everything I knew and soon enough they were out the door. The sirens on their cars wailed down the street and the flashing blues and reds faded into the distance. \\n\\nI’d like to say that it was a happy ending, because for the most part, it was. The kids got sent to the hospital and I had the chance to visit Henry in the hospital. Margaret was incarcerated and I’m back home, sitting safe and sound on my computer. However, there is one thing that continues to nag at me. At no time did the officer’s question me about the rose bushes, there was never any mention of it. Apparently, there were no traces of the roots in Henry’s or any of the other children’s legs. The fact that nobody mentioned it bothers me a lot. \\n\\nEarlier today, I drove up to an empty field beside Margaret’s house. I peeked through the oak trees, looking. But no matter how hard I looked, I couldn’t see the rose bushes. I squinted and even zoomed in on the house with my phone’s camera. They were gone. \\n</td>\n",

I’ve taken the advice of many of you and did not post again until the rest was all written out. \\n\\nSo, fair warning, this is really, REALLY long, but it’s also the last part of the story.\\n\\nI tried to answer some comments earlier, when I was at lunch and didn’t have time to write the rest of this out, but I’ll go back and try to reply to everything else now that this is finished.\\n\\nPart One: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zx5up/8th_grade_math/\\n\\nPart Two: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zxxxk/8th_grade_math_2/\\n\\nI wish I could tell you that things improved over Christmas break, but they only got worse. The first night of Christmas break I went to sleep only to have the most bizarre nightmare of my life. In the dream, Pedersen was just standing there in the same tacky suit he always wore. He just kept shouting “Punishment!”\\n\\nThe thing is, it wasn’t like a normal shout… it was like a screech. Very loud, very shrill. I woke up almost immediately and I was terrified. It took nearly an hour to get back to sleep, and as soon as I did, I had the same nightmare. Needless to say, I didn’t sleep that night.\\n\\nSince I couldn’t sleep, I went out to the living room to play some SNES and calm my nerves. My dogs – I had two Labradors – instinctively followed me and sat on the couch on either side of me. I just sat there in the dark, playing Super Mario World with the sound muted so I wouldn’t wake my parents.\\n\\nNow, our living room had a big front window. It took up a pretty good deal of the wall, and gave a great view of the yard and the street out front. At night we’d always keep the curtain drawn. Suddenly, both of my dogs jump off the couch and rush over to the window. They kinda pushed under the curtain and just started barking and hopping up on the window with their front paws on the glass.\\n\\nI had no idea what was going on. My chocolate lab liked to go out through the doggy door to our backyard and bark, but they never just went to the window and barked like this. I ran over to the window and looked out to see what was happening.\\n\\nThere was a pick-up truck parked in the middle of the street, right in front of my house. It looked a lot like Pedersen’s truck. I couldn’t see the driver, but it was enough to freak me out. Naturally my parents came out of their room pretty quick, and they were pissed to me awake in the middle of the night playing games.\\n\\nI freaked out and tried to tell them that there was a truck parked in front of our house. My dad looked out the window, since my dogs WERE freaking out. But the truck was gone. I guess it drove away when I turned to see my parents.\\n\\nThat was the beginning of the really unsettling stuff. I was freaked out.\\n\\nI didn’t sleep that night. I just tossed and turned. The next day I met Jamal at a pizza hut that was within bike riding distance of our neighborhood. Our plan was to get some pizza and head back to his house and talk about all of the weird stuff. I told him about seeing who I thought was Pedersen outside.\\n\\nAs we were leaving, I suddenly felt a lot of pressure on my knee. It was like someone was squeezing it, and naturally I went down quick. Landed face first in the pizza and cursed up a storm. As Jamal helped me back up, that’s when we saw him. Pedersen was in his pick up, parked on the other side of the parking lot and staring at us with that same cold, seething stare.\\n\\nOf course, I’d already hurt my knee the other day, so at this point it wouldn’t be a stretch to think I was just overexerting my injury… but I swear to you, it felt like there was a hand grabbing my knee and squeezing it.\\n\\nI ended up going home, staying in bed all day with my leg up and ice on my knee. The nightmares came back that night, and the next night. By the time Christmas break was over, there had only been a few nights when I actually slept. Christmas Eve and Christmas I was able to sleep through, and for a few days the nightmares only happened once or twice, but for the majority of our time off school, I had the nightmares.\\n\\nWhen school started up again, I was surprised to see Bethany was back. She didn’t say a word to me all day, until lunch when she got me and Jamal to follow her into one of the bathrooms. The three of us hid in the bathroom stall and we soon found out Bethany had been having the same nightmares we had.\\n\\nBethany was convinced that Pedersen was responsible for everything. Have to admit, the way she explained it… it was creepy. Jamal stole his gameboy back, and then Jamal’s gameboy gets broken. I fake a knee injury to distract him so Jamal can steal the gameboy, and then I start suffering real knee injuries. Not to mention Bethany’s mom yells at him embarrasses him at his job… and she dies in a car accident.\\n\\nOf course, Pedersen hadn’t actually done anything. The most he ever did was just stare at us.\\n\\nBethany was convinced he had caused it all somehow. At this point, I believed her. Too much weird stuff had happened. Right as we’re in the middle of this discussion, someone knocks on the stall door. I swear I hadn’t heard anyone enter the bathroom.\\n\\nWith three sets of legs under the stall, it was pretty obvious that something unusual was happening, but we thought we might be able to just stay quiet and keep the door locked. Suddenly the door opened. Jamal later swore to me that he had locked it, and I believe him.\\n\\nI’m sure it comes as no surprise that Pedersen was on the other side of the door. He stared at us, and then he just kind of smiled and said we were all in a lot of trouble.\\n\\nWell, we were. Two boys and a girl – all known “troublemakers” -- caught in a bathroom stall instead of being at lunch? The principal just assumed something sexual was happening. Schools are pretty strict about that stuff, and we all got in a lot of trouble.\\n\\nWe were all suspended for two weeks. I got lucky that my dad didn’t get to mad. He assumed that I was a curious 14 year old, and really the worst of my punishment was having to have the sex talk again, and him telling me not to do that kind of stuff at school.\\n\\nJamal wasn’t so lucky. His mom freaked out and grounded him, no phone, no leaving the house. \\n\\nBethany? Well, her dad was already a wreck. He took her mom’s death really hard, and when he heard why she was suspended, and that it involved Jamal and I (who had become frequent guests at her place over Christmas Break), he just assumed that we were trying to take advantage of her grief. We were forbidden from going over there and worse yet, I found out Bethany’s dad decided to move to Virginia, and they were going to leave immediately.\\n\\nWell, immediately meant a couple weeks, but that was still really fast to just up and move. So I spent the next two weeks at home, hanging out with the neighbor kids. I didn’t tell them about any of what was happening, doubted they’d believe me anyway.\\n\\nOne of my neighbors was named Matt. We’d hang out on occasion. We weren’t super close, but Matt’s dad was a big computer guy, so Matt had a lot of really cool games and although it makes me sound terrible, I pretty much hung out with him to play with his stuff. I know, but I was 14, and I admit I was an asshole.\\n\\nI was hanging at Matt’s house one day. It was after school hours, although I was still suspended. It was my turn to play on the computer, so Matt goes to walk his dog. While he’s gone, I get up to use the bathroom, and suddenly my knee gives out. I feel the same squeezing sensation I felt at the pizza hut.\\n\\nI fell into the table, knocked over his computer monitor. I ended up banging up my left arm pretty badly, and breaking the monitor. Matt comes back and he freaks out. Starts yelling at me, he’s pissed that I broke his dad’s computer. I explained it was an accident, but he didn’t care. He kicked me out and told me to expect his dad would be by my place when he got home.\\n\\nSo I walking home (Matt lived only one street over), and then I see him. Pedersen. He’s sitting at the end of the street in his pick up and staring at me. And I knew. I knew that somehow, as strange as it sounds, he was making my knee hurt. He was squeezing my knee somehow without ever actually physically touching me.\\n\\nI freaked. I’d have to walk right by him to get home. I waited for him to leave, but he didn’t. He just sat there on the side of the road, staring at me. After ten minutes of this, I turned and just walked down another street. I didn’t know where I was going, I just wanted to be away from him. I knew that if I got near his truck, something bad was going to happen.\\n\\nI couldn’t get to Jamal’s house, since he lived on the other side of me. I decided to try to get to Bethany’s. If you recall, she lived further than the neighborhood where Jamal and I lived. It wasn’t terribly far, but I was used to riding my bike down there. I’d never walked that far before, especially not in pain.\\n\\nSomehow I made it. Twice along the way I thought I saw Pedersen’s truck behind me, but he’d turn down a side street whenever I turned around. I don’t have words to describe how scared I was. I was hurt, alone, it was getting dark and my teacher was stalking me and I was convinced he had the power to hurt me without ever touching me. And I should point out; I did not have a cell phone. I didn’t get one of those until I started college. So I had no way to contact my family, or the police, or anyone.\\n\\nI made it to Bethany’s house, and by the time I did it was dark outside. I knew Bethany’s dad had forbidden me from coming over, but to my relief when I got there his car was gone. I knocked on the door and Bethany answered.\\n\\nI told her what happened, and that I was pretty sure Pedersen was following me. She asked what I wanted to do, if we should call the police, but I knew they wouldn’t believe us. We were a couple of fourteen years old, known troublemakers, on suspension and everyone assumed she was acting out over her mom’s death.\\n\\nEven if we’d be honor roll students, would the cops believe that a teacher was somehow hurting me without ever touching me? \\n\\nBethany told me that they were moving soon. She was in tears, saying she couldn’t believe Pedersen was going to just get away with all of this. I told her I’d do whatever I could… but I didn’t know what I could do. He was a teacher. Sure, nobody liked him, but he still had more credibility than I did.\\n\\nI called my dad, had him pick me up. He was pissed. Both because he knew I wasn’t supposed to be at Bethany’s house, and because Matt’s dad had called. Now I was in trouble, and I spent the rest of my suspension grounded\\n\\nThe nightmares kept coming. Some nights they wouldn’t come and I’d sleep okay… but most nights I only got at most, three hours of sleep. Not three hours in a row, but three hours total. The rest was the nightmares and trying to go back to sleep.\\n\\nBy the time my suspension was over, I was a wreck. Bethany had moved away, Jamal was keeping his distance too. I guess his parents told him to stay away from me because they blamed me for getting him in trouble.\\n\\nSo I was alone, really. With so little sleep my grades were falling. I started drinking copious amounts of soda for the caffeine since I wasn’t sleeping well, and that made me start gaining a lot of weight. I sort of became a lone, not talking to anyone, barely paying attention in class.\\n\\nBy February, it was obvious something was wrong with me. My parents assumed I was struggling in school, and turns out the school started worrying about my home life. Mr. Hall, my science teacher, eventually had me go to his office at lunch. He asked me what was wrong, but I brushed it off.\\n\\nThat’s when he asked me a question that made my jaw drop.\\n\\n“Does this have anything to do with Mr. Pedersen?”\\n\\nI can’t really describe what that moment was like. Like I said, I never thought of telling anyone about Pedersen, since I didn’t think anyone would believe me. Now, I had an adult – my beloved science teacher – asking me if Pedersen was part of the problem.\\n\\nSo I just nodded. I wasn’t about to tell him that I thought Pedersen had been harrassig me for months, or that I thought he had some kind of power to hurt me from long distances, or that I thought he had somehow killed Bethany’s mother.\\n\\nMr. Hall got this odd look on his face. He kept staring at me. After what seemed like an eternity, he finally told me that I should go to his house after school. That it wasn’t safe to talk here, but we could talk there.\\n\\nBefore everything with Pedersen, I would have been weirded out by a teacher asking me to their house… but if there was even a chance that Mr. Hall could help, I had to try it. I was alone and miserable and I needed help. \\n\\nAfter school, I met him in the parking lot and went with him to his house. On the way, I thought I saw Pedersen’s pick up behind us, but when I tried to tell Hall he just shushed me and told me not to talk.\\n\\nI have to admit, I was terrified. Mr. Hall was a big guy. He had been in the army when he was younger and he looked like he could still fight if he wanted to. When we got to his house, he ushered inside and took me into his living room. \\n\\nHe sat down and he asked me to tell him what was really going on. I remember his exact words.\\n\\n“Tell me the truth, even if you think it sounds unbelievable. If you lie to me, I can’t help you.”\\n\\nSo I told him. Everything I have told you, I told him. He sat there totally quiet, not moving, not questioning and never looking away. He didn’t even raise his eyebrows when I told him how I thought Pedersen was hurting me without ever being near me, or how I suspected Pedersen had killed Bethany’s mother somehow.\\n\\nI sat there and I half expected him to call me crazy. Instead he patted me on the shoulder and thanked me for being honest. Then he told me that he believed me.\\n\\nI was amazed. Without thinking I just blurted out “Why?”\\n\\nAnd he told me. Apparently, Mr. Hall used to teach at the same college where Mr. Pedersen taught. He said that he had never known Pedersen back then; aside from a few times they passed each other on campus.\\n\\nHe also told me that there had been a couple of very strange accident at the college. There had been a rash of vandalisms at the college campus. Some students were breaking into classrooms and spray painting things on the walls, breaking equipment, breaking into teacher’s desks, stuff like that. The last classroom that was broken into was Pedersen’s.\\n\\nTwo days later, three students, apparently drunk, crashed their car into one of the campus buildings. The students all died, and some stolen items from teachers were found in the trunk, along with spray paint in the back seat. They had been the vandals.\\n\\nThe whole campus was horrified… except Pedersen, who Hall described as being exuberant in his happiness the day after the accident. Hall wrote it off as Pedersen being a weirdo.\\n\\nLater, the campus let several teachers go. Hall and Pedersen included. The next day, the administrator who made the cuts fell down the stairs. Hall and another fired professor had been waiting near the door to talk to him when he fell. They checked on him, and Hall went to go get help.\\n\\nHe said when he left the building, he saw Pedersen just standing in the middle of the grounds, staring at the building. He described the same cold seething glare I had described Pedersen having.\\n\\nI was astonished as Hall finished the story. He told me that he and Pedersen both ending up at my school was just coincidence. He also told me that he had been keeping an eye on Pedersen ever since he saw the way he would always show up late and leave his class out in the cold.\\n\\nI didn’t know what to say. I asked Hall how Pedersen could be doing this, and he told me he had no idea. That wasn’t the answer I was hoping for, but… it was nice to have someone – an adult – who believed me.\\n\\n Finally I started getting worked up. I told Hall we had to do something. If he believed me, if he knew Pedersen was somehow responsible, then we had to stop him. Go to police. I figured they’d have to believe Mr. Hall. He was a teacher, he was a veteran! I was convinced the police would listen.\\n\\nHall brought me crashing back down to reality. He pointed out that Pedersen hadn’t done anything. He’d never actually laid his hands on me, and there was no way we could prove the accidents had actually been caused by him.\\n\\nHall drove me home, told me to keep my chin, everything would be fine. I wasn’t convinced… but that night, I didn’t have the nightmares.\\n\\nI was confident for the first time in a long time that maybe this would all work out.\\n\\nThe next day, as I’m leaving Pedersen’s class, he tells me stay behind. I suddenly became a nervous wreck. Everyone else shuffled out, and the next period wouldn’t be showing up until after lunch.\\n\\nPedersen asked me why I had been at Hall’s house. Now I was scared. I told him I hadn’t been at Hall’s house, and that’s when my knee started hurting again. I fell to the floor, Pedersen was just glaring at me. I tried to scream, but no sound came out.\\n\\nAfter a minute, the squeezing sensation stopped. Pedersen kind of shuddered and then he spoke. He told me that he wasn’t a fool, and that he knew that I knew more than I should. He told me that I was clumsy, and that if I kept up this pace I might have a serious accident.\\n\\nI knew what he was really saying. If I didn’t stop poking my nose into his business, I was going to die. I asked him why me. What had I ever done to get on his shit list? I asked me why my dreams kept screeching “Punishment!” at me.\\n\\n… his answer was not what I expected. I’m guessing it’s not what you expected either.\\n\\nHe said I was the perfect example of what was wrong with kids these days. That I was rude, that I had no respect for authority, that I was a troublemaker, a slacker and that kids like me were a disgrace.\\n\\nNow, I don’t deny his charges. I WAS rude and a slacker and I had no respect for authority. That’s all true. I was a 14 year old boy.\\n\\nBut it amazed me that THAT was his answer. That was why he was so mad. I hadn’t done anything of real consequence. I hadn’t hurt him in some way, I’d certainly made some pretty rude jokes about him, but… everyone did.\\n\\nApparently I wasn’t anything special. I hadn’t done anything more than anyone else, he just chose to single out me, Jamal and Bethany. I guess he thought we were the worst of the students. Maybe we were… but none of us did drugs. I got in a couple of fights, and so did Jamal, but way less than some students.\\n\\nBut somehow, to him, we deserved punishment. And instead of just failing us in Pre-Algebra, he was determined to make our lives hell. \\n\\nI didn’t get a chance to respond to Pedersen’s answer. The door burst open and in came Hall. Before Pedersen could say a word, Hall grabbed him by the collar and thrust him up against the wall.\\n\\nHall told Pedersen that he didn’t care what he could do, that if Pedersen hurt another student, then Hall was going to relive his days in Vietnam on Pedersen’s backside.\\n\\nPedersen looked terrified. I kept expecting Hall’s head to explode or something… but Pedersen seemed genuinely scared, and helpless. Hall hit him in the stomach and told him to quit his job. Then Hall walked me to the nurse.\\n\\nI was astonished. \\n\\nThat night I had no nightmares. The next day when I got to school, I found out that we had subs for both Pedersen and Hall’s classes. We had those subs for the rest of the week.\\n\\nI wanted to go to Hall’s house and see if he was okay, but it was too far to bike. \\n\\nThe next week when I got to school, we got a surprising announcement. Mr. Pedersen was no longer going to be teaching Pre-Algebra. Apparently he had taken a different teaching opportunity. I didn’t have the nightmares again after that.\\n\\nMr. Hall didn’t get back to school for another two weeks. When he did, he had a scar on his face, on the brim of his nose, and another one on his neck. As soon as class was over, I asked him what happened.\\n\\nHe just told me not to ask. He said it should be alright, that Pedersen was gone and he wouldn’t be back. He told me to forget everything.\\n\\nAfter that things got better. So much so that I really thought it was over. I was able to sleep again, my grades picked back up and I started losing the weight I’d gained. Best of all, we got a new teacher. She was always on time, she was a great teacher and best of all; she wasn’t vindictive and didn’t have any strange powers.\\n\\nNothing else happened for the rest of the school year. Sadly, my friendship with Jamal never recovered, and I never saw Bethany again. Over the summer I got a girlfriend named Laura, and I became good friends with her brother Craig.\\n\\nOne day when we were out riding our bikes, I suddenly felt that same squeezing sensation in my knee. I screamed and crashed my bike. I got pretty banged up. I didn’t even care, I just started looking around. Laura and Craig had run over and helped me up, but I was terrified and not paying attention to them.\\n\\nI looked around, and there he was. Pedersen’s pick up was parked on the street and he was standing in front of it. He had the same cold seething stare as he looked at me.\\n\\nThe next thing I knew, I felt the squeezing sensation again, but not on my knee. I felt it on my neck. He was choking me. I knew I was going to die. Craig and Laura were trying to help me, but they didn’t know what was happening.\\n\\nI was blacking out. My chest was burning. I knew I was going to die.\\n\\nThen I heard a terrible sound. It was like thunder and a crunch of metal. The squeezing sensation stopped, I could breathe again. When I finally at up, after a lot of coughing, I saw what happened.\\n\\nA car crashed right into the pick-up. Pedersen was caught between the two vehicles. He was dead. It was Hall’s car that crashed into him. I don’t know how Hall knew to be there, but he had crashed right into Pedersen. Hall survived the crash, but he ended up in a wheelchair from it.\\n\\nThat was pretty much the end of it. I still have problems with my knee. A year later my parents split up and I moved away from Maryland, I’ve never been back.\\n\\nI still have no idea how Pedersen did what he did. I know it wasn’t normal. \\n\\nYou don’t have to believe me. I wouldn’t believe it if I hadn’t lived through it. I’m just glad I DID live through it.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>This is less of a \"scary\" story and more of a curious one. It might chill you slightly, but it offers me comfort in comparison to what I've witnessed. Consider this not as a warning, but as a foresight in what I'm about to share with you.\\n\\nIt was November in 2003, I was twelve years old. Me, my mother, my brother and my father all lived in a nice Cape Cod home together. My father had struggled with heart problems his entire life, and a line of heart-related deaths run deep into my family's history. It finally claimed his life on that 9th of November, which was a Sunday. It was literally the most traumatic day of my life. \\n\\nAfter his death I felt nothing but numbness. I tried to cope with the notion of never seeing him again. My mother took it way worse than I did, and my brother, being eighteen at the time, tried to soak it up and had to function as the new man of the house. Luckily we had family on both sides and tons of friends to come visit the night after it happened and to keep us company and share in our grief. It was a very tough time in our lives. Losing him left a giant void in all of our hearts.\\n\\nThe next morning I awoke on the couch in my living room. The night previous I had passed out I assume from all the stress I experienced the day prior. My mother was already awake in the kitchen at the table with her usual cup of coffee, and my brother was sitting across from her. I could hear them whispering quietly about our future, and that my father loved us all very much. I recall meeting them in the kitchen and sharing a three-way group hug and sobbing softly in the morning light.\\n\\nWe decided we needed to do something positive to keep ourselves occupied, because we were never one to sit and wallow in our sorrows. We had each other to depend on, and that was what kept us motivated. My mother decided to make waffles, eggs and bacon for breakfast. We sat in the kitchen all morning, talking and sharing our first laughs and celebrating in his memory what we'd do if he was here or not. Despite what we'd been through, we had a nice breakfast together. We spent the rest of the day looking over old photographs of past birthday parties, Christmases and home movies shot on our old Canon video camera, misty eyed and bitter sweet together on the sofa.\\n\\nAll week we received call after call on our house phone from relatives offering their sympathies and calls from my friends to see if I was alright and when I'd be coming back to school. Gift baskets and bouquets of flowers appeared on our door step day after day. It made us all feel quite nice. Our answering machine tape was flooded with missed calls from people who were friends of the family, so we had to clear the history. My mom went through the tapes as I sat with her in the kitchen, doing makeup homework. \\n\\nOne particular message caught our attention. It was the very last message on the tape, not quite \"fitting in\" with the others. It didn't fit in because it wasn't a message at all, rather background noise of several people talking. My mom turned the volume up on the answering machine, and we could both hear the sound of me, my mom and my brother, conversing, laughing occasionally and the clatter of silverware and plates. The message lasted for over ten minutes, and with each progressing minute, my mother's demeanor turned more and more mournful. Her eyes welled up with tears and they turned stingy and red, and she put her hand over her mouth.\\n\\nThere was a silent beat in our conversation on the tape, and at that moment my mom finally shattered the silence, \"I miss you Ben.\" The message ended, finalizing the tape.\\n\\nI'm convinced of it, my mother is convinced of it, and so is my brother. In an attempt to be with his family one last time, he chose to spend Monday morning breakfast with us in our answering machine.\\n\\nNow it's almost a decade later. I'm 20 now and I've matured a great deal. I still think of him constantly and the memories I have of him. Just recently, as we were moving back into our old house, I found the tapes of our old voice messages. The ones left by him before he passed. \"You have reached xxx-xxx-xxxx, please leave a message after the beep\". There were two voice messages left, and the last tape had our old Monday morning breakfast on it.\\n\\nI slipped the tape tenderly back into the answering machine and hit play. It was all I could do to keep from sobbing.\\n\\nThe tape still sits in our armoire in a crystal bowl with his picture next to it, and several rose petals. The petals, to this day, have not withered.</td>\n",

Maybe I’ve vaguely referenced certain aspects about the ordeal here and there, it would have been impossible not to considering its impact, but I’ve never regaled it in its entirety.\\n\\nI’ve been cleaning out the basement at my mom’s house, and towards the back, buried under a mess of boxes filled with random junk and old clothes, was a small, clear,  plastic storage container. I had no idea that my mom had kept the letters.\\n\\nThe letters began not long after my best friend Ben, the kid from whom I’d been just shy of inseparable since we were three years old, was moving away. I remember being crushed that day, when Ben came up to me in our fourth grade class with puffy eyes and told me he and his mom were leaving town.\\n\\nThat night at home, my mom explained that her father, Ben's grandpa, was no longer capable of caring for himself. As such, his mom had decided to move out to the very small town in which he lived, which itself was two states over, and stay in his house until such time her assistance was no longer necessary. My mom also suggested I get their new address and give them mine, so Ben and I could write back and forth.\\n\\nAnd so we did, starting with the first letter Ben sent me, a couple months after they left.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nNovember 19th, 1999\\n\\nHey dude,\\n\\nIt’s very boring here. There is **nothing** to do. Not outside at least. But guess what…….my mom got me SO many games. Crash Team Racing, Crash Bandicoot Warped, Dino Crisis, DRIVER!!!! 007: Tomorrow Never Dies, and then these two games called Grand Theft Auto but they’re weird and the graphics are stupid. Driver is the coolest one but I haven’t played 007 too much yet because I just got it. You should come visit sometime and check out Driver. And I’m still playing Tony Hawk a lot…..duh!!!!\\n\\nThe next house is far away from ours and there’s nothing at our house that’s any fun. School is dumb too. There’s kids from 3 different towns that go to my new school my teacher said. And I already know everything there teaching. I wish I could come back home. \\n\\nOh and my mom met a old friend of hers named Joe and he’s been here a lot. He’s nice and he plays Playstation with me. I think he lets me win but he says he doesn’t.\\n\\nWe have to make our moms let you come out here or let me come back there. Dude...what if my mom would let me come live with you? We would basically be brothers. Talk to your mom and see if she would let me. I’ll talk to mine too.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nBen Nebel\\n\\nP.S. Sk8 Broz 4 Life\\n\\n_____\\n\\n\\nIt might be cringy to you, but Sk8 Broz was what we lived for back then. We were gonna be pro skateboarders. It was a dumb dream, but it was ours. \\n\\nWe generally sent a letter back and forth every week. This went on for about seven months, with us just telling each other about our weeks, what was going on with the people from our respective schools, and both of us regaling how we’d tried to convince our moms to let Mike come live with us back home.\\n\\nBut the most prevalent theme of the letters was Ben’s lamenting of the situation as a whole.\\n\\n“I wish I never had to come to this stupid house.”\\n\\n“I hate living with my grandpa. He doesn’t even remember who we are a lot.”\\n\\n“My school is the worst. All the kids there are dumb, you would hate them.”\\n\\nAt least two of these types of statements were made in each letter. That’s why it was so surprising when, after those seven months of letters of that type, there was a lull of about two months, at the end of which I received one from him, one where his attitude had seemingly completely reversed.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nSeptember 2nd, 2000\\n\\nHey Nick!\\n\\nGuess what?? I found a skatepark a few minutes away from my house, it’s sick! Since not a lot of people live here it’s not very busy that much. The woods here are pretty cool too. I think I just didn’t like them because it’s been cold. \\n\\nThis is actually a pretty fun place. Some of the kids are pretty cool actually. There not Sk8 Broz cool, but there ok. Joe bought me a Playstation 2!!! And the games Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2 and Dynasty Warriors 2!!! \\n\\nMy grandpa is still my grandpa, but he’s doing okay I guess.\\n\\nGUESS WHAT? My mom said she would pay for you guys to drive out here. She said she feels bad you haven’t come back and I haven’t come home and so she said she’ll pay!!!\\n\\nShe told me to tell you to ask your mom to take some time off work to come out and visit. In your next letter let me know when she is able to do that so my mom can too. FINALLY BRO!!!\\n\\nBen Nebel\\n\\n_____\\n\\n\\nThe last letter I’d received before that one was much like they’d always been. Unenthusiastic, withdrawn, scornful, all of his surroundings. It was a sudden switch, but I was happy for him. I kept my mom apprised of his letters, letting her know what was going on on their end of things. When it came to this letter, she finally relented and promised me she’d take some time off work in a couple months, even going so far as letting me miss school for a few days so we could visit before it got too cold and started snowing.\\n\\nI wrote him back a few days later, giving him the dates my mom had notified her firm she wouldn’t be in, as well as requesting their phone number. I got Ben’s reply very shortly thereafter.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nSeptember 12th, 2000\\n\\nHey man,\\n\\nMy mom said those days are perfect and she asked off work. FINALLY DUDE!!! There aren’t any houses to trick or treat at so we will just have to hang out on Halloween (BEST HOLIDAY EVER) but you should still bring a costume. We will have to go to the skatepark and play my PS2. Did you get a PS2?? If you did bring your games if they aren’t ones I have.\\n\\nHere is our number. Joe (my moms friend) might answer. She said your mom can call and make sure it is all ok.\\n\\nxxx-xxx-xxxx\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nBen Nebel\\n\\n_____\\n\\nMy mom did indeed call, and Ben’s mom boyfriend Joe indeed answered. He politely informed my mom that Joanna (Ben’s mom) wan’t yet back from work, but that everything as planned was good to go, and that they were excited to see us (and he to meet us), remarking that there was rarely a time that Ben didn’t relate a conversation to me/his hometown in some way, and that it would be good for him to see me. After getting and writing down the directions to their home two states over, my mom hung up the phone and informed me of the good news.\\n\\nOur plan spanned seven days: one day for driving and getting there, five days there, and a day to drive and get back home. We left on October 26th, a Thursday. I was so excited; I can’t even find the words to describe how amped up I was. I was finally going to see my closest friend, the person to whom I related most that I hadn’t seen for the better part of a year. On top of that, I was getting to miss school, and on top of *that*, it was going to be Halloween, our favorite holiday. By all accounts, this was shaping up to be a great week.\\n\\nWe made the 10 ½ hour drive and upon the last few directions my mom had been given, we found ourselves traversing long, empty roads. Finally, we made the last directed turn and in the distance we could see a house.\\n\\nDusk had settled, and it was that odd few moments where it’s light out and dark out simultaneously when we pulled up to the house. We parked next to Joanna’s van (which was “decorated” with a large dent in the driver’s side that I had made but that Ben had taken the blame for) and another car that presumably belonged to her boyfriend, Joe.\\n\\nAs we got out of the car, a man emerged from the front door of the house, wearing a Frankenstein costume.\\n\\n“Hey guys! Welcome, welcome, welcome! I’m Joe, you must be Amber and Nick! Hey Nick, a little birdie told us that your favorite holiday is Halloween, so we thought we’d start the celebration early! I hope you brought a costume!”\\n\\nI was instantly ecstatic. “I did, I brought a costume!” I yelled up to the man. \\n\\n“Well suit up, partner! We have a surprise all set up for you when you’re ready! Ben wanted to make you guys reuniting extra spectacular.”\\n\\nI asked my mom if I could change into it right away, to which she obliged. I sprinted up the porch steps with my bag and was directed by Joe to the bathroom while he stayed behind to greet my mother. As I walked through the house I heard him say “Very nice to meet you, Amber. Joanna’s finishing things in the basement. Ben set up a…”\\n\\nI remember looking around their house and finding the mess within it strange. It wasn’t exceptionally messy or anything, but Ben’s mom was always kind of a neat freak; their house never had anything out of place. This new house, however, had dirty dishes on the dining room table, piles of clothes all over the place, things like that. Again, nothing too outrageous, just uncharacteristic.\\n\\nI changed into my Power Ranger costume in the bathroom and walked back to the living room, where my mom and Joe stood talking. Besides the bit of a mess, the house was decorated for Halloween pretty elaborately. There were (obviously decorative) cobwebs all over the place, bowls of candy throughout the house, a decorative skeleton in a chair in the corner of the living room, stuff like that. I was very excited to see what they’d done with the basement.\\n\\nJoe ushered us towards the basement door and opened it to let us through, closing it behind him. There were small lights on each of the steps we used to guide us down, and once we got to the bottom of the steps, we were forced to turn left down a very narrow walkway. \\n\\nI remember being scared; the darkness and confinement was overwhelming. But I also remember my mom leaning down and whispering to me “It’s okay, Ben told Joe how much you guys liked the haunted maze you went to a couple years ago, so he built one for you guys here since there’s none around here.”\\n\\nMy mom kept her hand on my shoulder as we walked through. Lights would flash and things would pop out and drop down and loud noises would blast from speakers just like a normal haunted maze, and for being in a basement, I recall it being surprisingly well done. I heard Joe from behind my mom say “the finale is just up ahead”.\\n\\nWe made one more turn and found two small lights pointed up at a pair of dark blue curtains hanging down. \\n\\n“Let me sneak by you guys quick, come in when I tell you, he wants this to be perfect.” Joe said enthusiastically as he brushed past us and through the curtains, being sure to keep them as closed as possible so as not to ruin the surprise. \\n\\n“Ready to see your best friend? I know how much you guys have been looking forward to this!” he said from behind the curtain. And I was. It had been nearly a year since I’d seen Ben, and I was more than ready. \\n\\nAfter just a few seconds, we heard “Come in!” followed by a comical spooky laugh, like the kind a Scooby-Doo villain would make.\\n\\nI was so excited to see my best friend. My mom whispered for me to go ahead, and I walked through the curtains, and there he was, along with his mom and two other men.\\n\\nHis mom was nude, her body cut into eight pieces, all of them nailed to the wall, fashioned to make it look as if she was waving to us. Ben’s grandpa was in a rocking chair, also nude, with his hands sewn to his ankles and his feet sewn to his wrists. His mouth had been cut at the edges of his lips and his mouth was open twice as far as any person’s mouth should be able to open.\\n\\nNext to him was another man, presumably (and later confirmed to be) the real Joe , hung from a rope tied to a load-bearing beam in the ceiling, all the skin from his torso removed. His tongue was nailed into his forehead (That may have actually been Ben’s grandpa, but I don’t think so. It’s been a long time and like I said, I’ve done my best to not think about it).\\n\\nDrinking glasses of various sizes as well as saucers and bowls were strewn about the floor, all filled with blood (I’m assuming). On the wall, made from strips of the real Joe’s removed skin were the words “Missed you!”.\\n\\nTo the left was the man who had posed as Joe, who had terrified, sobbing Ben bound on his knees facing me. Ben was filthy, as if he hadn’t bathed or changed his clothes in months. Joe quickly tore away the piece of duct tape that was covering my best friend’s mouth and said “Quick! Say hi!”\\n\\nBen just continued crying. I don’t even think he had time to comprehend his chance at last words. \\n\\nThis whole thing lasted less than five seconds. I had walked through those curtains and stopped in my tracks, blocking my mom from entering the area. She had soon thereafter poked her head through and immediately pulled back from whence we’d came to run back through the “maze”.\\n\\nThe last image I have of my best friend in the world, the person with whom I shared every interest, the other half of the would-be skateboard phenom team the Sk8 Broz, was of him on his knees in front of a psychopath, sobbing, as that psychopath took a hacksaw to his neck and started thrusting his arm back.\\n\\nAs my mom repeatedly told me to “go, move, run”, all I could hear was the gurgled screams of Ben Nebel, and at one point, the loud voice of the madman who’d taken his life:\\n\\n“Oh come on! You’re not even gonna let him watch?! You’re no fun!” followed by a disturbingly calm yet loud laughter.\\n\\nWe found our way back to the stairs, where my mom told me to go outside and get in the car and lock the doors. Knowing now wasn’t the time to question her, I abided. I looked back as I ran through the hallway and saw her tip over a bookshelf in front of the basement door. \\n\\nShe was gone for about 20 seconds after that, but she finally emerged from within the house, ran to the car, and we drove away, stopping at the end of the street. She explained that she’d been looking for and eventually found a phone in their house and called the police, quickly said a murder had occurred and said she’d be at the end of the road from Ben’s house, the address to which she’d luckily put at the top of the contents of her purse when we’d gone in.\\n\\nGiven that we were in the literal middle of nowhere. It took the police nearly 20 minutes to arrive. When they did, we led them to the house, and they entered. I remember asking my mom what if the man had run away, but she told me she was confident the bookshelf was too heavy to move from the other side of the basement door,\\n\\nAs it turns out, the man hadn’t tried to get out through the basement door.\\n\\nHe hadn’t tried to get out at all.\\n\\nHe simply placed the head of my best friend on a small table next to him, wrote a note (or maybe he had it prewritten, I don’t recall), put a single-barrel shotgun in mouth and pulled the trigger.\\n\\nI will forever have the images of my best friend’s mother, her boyfriend, and her grandfather in their final stages, all the viscera and sinew that accompanies dismembered and skinned bodies. I will forever have the image of the last time my eyes laid upon my best friend, the image burned into my ten year old eyes of him him with tears streaming down his face and a hacksaw pressed against his neck.\\n\\nBut the part about that whole ordeal that sticks with me more than any of that….is the note their killer left.\\n\\n**You probably want to know why I did it, right?**\\n\\n**I don’t know...I saw an opportunity and I took it. It was pretty funny though right?**\\n\\n**Be honest :)**\\n\\n[NBH](http://www.nickbotic.com)</td>\n",

       "112244  Hey guys!  \\n\\nHere's a link to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3sldxd/i_found_a_locked_room_in_the_basement_of_my_new/ \\n\\n\\nFirstly I would like to thank all of you who came to aid me in this dark situation, many of you had some great advice. Some of you were also definitely right in pointing out that I was an idiot for opening the hatch even though it clearly said not to. That was intensely stupid and believe me, I will not make that mistake again.  \\n\\n\\nSorry for the wall of text, but in the last week a lot has transpired. A few hours after posting, Chris arrived, which was a huge relief for me. He'd swung by his parents' house and picked up his dad's shotgun. That night was relatively quiet, I slept like a log after being awake for so long the night before. Afterwards Chris told me that he did hear that clicking sound I described before, although only for a few seconds, then it was gone. He didn't feel particularly compelled to go check it out in the middle of the night, so he just went back to sleep.\\n  \\nThat morning I called the realtor. I was a bit hesitant to tell him about the creature I saw, for fear that he might think I'm crazy. So I just told him I found a hatch and I would like to find out what it was for. He reacted rather dismissively, but when I told him about the plaque that said \"KEEP SHUT AT ALL TIMES\" and that I opened it anyway, he relented. The previous resident died (of natural causes, in a hospital, don't worry, I asked), leaving the house to his only son. The son had no interest in living in it so he put it on the market. The realtor said he'd give him a call and he'd get back to me.  \\n\\nAfter that, Chris and I got ready to check out the basement. I was holding the flashlight and he was armed with the shotgun. We agreed I'd shine the flashlight into the hatch and he'd try to see what's in there. With my heart in my throat I walked down the basement stairs. I went and stood next to the hatch first and aimed the light in from an angle. Chris took a deep breath and hopped off of the staircase. He walked up next to me and quietly lay the barrel of the gun in the opening. With his finger on the trigger he peered in. Although he initially seemed tense, he calmed down after that. \\n\\n'It's just an empty room,' he said, 'It's kinda big, but apart from that it's pretty much just the basement minus the old junk, ha-ha.' I laughed nervously and was about to ask to go upstairs again, when, all of a sudden, a loud bang! Despite the fact that we'd worn earplugs as protection, my ears were ringing like crazy. I looked over to Chris just in time to see him fire the gun a second time. I stared in shock as my ears rang even worse. After that, he pulled the gun out, shut the hatch and locked it.  \\n\\nWhen my hearing had finally returned, Chris explained what he'd seen. 'It was just like the creature that you described, but it wasn't just one of them. There must have been at least two, maybe three. I was about to propose going upstairs again when I saw something glisten in a dark corner. At first I thought it was just water or something, but then it moved. Turns out it was its eyes! But I definitely saw more than one pair of eyes.' \\n\\nThe rest of the day the atmosphere was glum. We didn't really know what to say to each other and we couldn't relax after what just happened. \\nI couldn't make much sense of it all until after dinner, when I got an email.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\n*Hello Claire and Chris,* \\n\\n*I am the guy you bought the house from! The realtor passed me your contact info, I hope you don't mind. I am so sorry that no one told you about the hatch and I am really sorry that you opened it, that was a very bad idea.*  \\n\\n*Also, sorry, if what I'm about to tell you next is in too much gruesome detail for you, but I want to illustrate how these things are a force to be reckoned with. If you can, just leave. Seriously.* \\n\\n*My parents bought the house in '84 as a getaway for the weekends and the holidays, although, in the end, we only spent about a week there as a family.*  \\n\\n*It was the end of June when we first arrived. We were supposed to stay there for a whole month. As a ten-year-old with no siblings I was pretty bummed to spend most of the summer in the middle of nowhere. So on the way there and all of the first day, I was whining, crying and droning on that I wanted to go home. I guess that's why my parents didn't take me too seriously when I told them that I'd seen a monster that night. It was about nine PM and the sun had just gone under. It was the holidays, so I was allowed to stay up longer than usual. I was out, playing on the porch with my toys as I heard a rattling sound coming from deeper in the woods. I got up to get a better look and that's when I saw a tall figure standing in between the trees, only barely lit by the moonlight. At first I thought it was maybe one of the neighbors and naively I called out to it. It definitely heard me and it approached. As it crept closer I noticed that something was really off about the way it moved. It seemed to have tremendous trouble walking while on its back legs and eventually it dropped on all fours. That's when it picked up tremendous speed. I panicked and ran inside, slamming the door behind me. When I looked out of the window it was gone.* \\n\\n*Like I said, initially my parents did not believe me. They told me no amount of imaginary monsters would get me home, so I better just get used to it. Yeah.* \\n\\n*For a bit I could barely sleep at night, and usually I would keep crying to my parents until they let me sleep in bed with them. Though, after a couple of days of nothing happening I figured that maybe I really HAD imagined it and I tried sleeping in my own bed again. And everything did seem fine at first.*  \\n\\n*However, in the dead of night, I suddenly woke up from a rattling sound. A feeling of dread filled me promptly. I opened my eyes and I saw a pair of eyes staring right back at me. This black creepy person was hanging from the ceiling. I couldn’t make out that much in the dark, but its grey eyes and pointy white teeth were crystal clear. I lay there completely terrified for a few seconds, before my instincts kicked in and I started screaming like a banshee. Almost directly the thing let go from the ceiling and dropped right on top of me. It grabbed my upper arms and squeezed me so tight I couldn't breathe. I tried to scream but there was just no more air in my lungs. I can still recall its stomach-churning face as if it were yesterday. Its eyes were so cold and clouded, almost like those of a dead person. Its skin was dry and hard. It seemed to be stretched so tight that it couldn't close its mouth completely, leaving it slightly opened, almost smiling, but not quite. Then, it dug into me. I could feel its sharp teeth break the skin of my neck and the warm wet blood soaking my pajamas. As its grasp released I cried out in agony. That's when my father barged through the door.*  \\n\\n*The next thing I remember is being in the hospital. I'd had to get stitches for the wound in my neck.*  \\n\\n*My father had apparently shot the thing with the handgun he kept in the nightstand. It had immediately fled through the window.* \\n\\n*My father insisted that my mother and I leave pronto, while he stayed to figure out what that thing was. My mother wouldn't have any of it initially, but he must have somehow convinced her, because the last thing I remember from that week is waving my dad goodbye from the backseat of our Volvo.* \\n\\n*When my father came home two weeks later he was different in a way that I could never really grasp. He refused to talk about it after that.* \\n\\n*In the spring of '86 my parents got a divorce. Me and my mom stayed in our house in the suburbs, while my father moved to the holiday home. They had shared custody, so most weekends, at least for the first few years, I was with my dad.*  \\n\\n*The first day back in there my dad sat me down to talk about the thing I saw in '84. He said there was a lot more than one of them, he called them \"Lurkers\". Fortunately, they were mostly, if not altogether, gone by now. Regardless, there were a few things to keep in mind, he said.*  \\n\\n*1. Don't go in the basement.*  \\n\\n*2. If you really have to go in the basement, NEVER OPEN THE HATCH. (Sorry guys...)*\\n \\n*3. Never go out in the dark without a gun.* \\n \\n*4. Never go anywhere without a flashlight.* \\n\\n \\n*He still wouldn't tell me much about them, so the few things I cán tell you about the \"lurkers\" are these:*  \\n\\n*They're practically immortal. My dad said that, as far as he knew, literally nothing kills them.Their skin is very tough to break, bullets will not penetrate. As far as that goes, guns are pretty much useless.* \\n\\n*They're also practically blind. In the dark they cán see, but only barely and if you stand very still they can't really tell you from the background anymore. Any kind of light blinds them completely. This is why you should always carry a flashlight. They avoid light like the plague, so it's a great way to deter them IF they haven't noticed you. If they have, however, heard you or seen you already, light won't be enough to scare it off anymore.*\\n \\n*Because of the blindness they operate on hearing. Their hearing is extremely well developed so you'd need to be completely still not to be heard by them. This, however, is where a gun comes in handy. If you're familiar with guns, you'll also be familiar with the impact of a gunshot on an unprotected ear. Firing a gun will leave them temporarily deafened and therefore defenseless. I imagine that is how my dad managed to capture them all.* \\n\\n*I say 'them áll' because after the summer of '84 I have never seen one again. My dad never outright told me they were locked in the basement, but I have heard the rattling sound coming from there often enough that I know for sure they were.* \\n\\n*As far as where they come from, the what or why, or how, I don't know. I know nothing. My father was very secretive about it.*\\n\\n*My dad and I got estranged later on and I actually hadn't talked to him in years before he died. I don't know what he has been up to. However, I do have most of his possessions in my attic so maybe I can find something there that will give you an idea of what to do. Right now, though, I don't know anything or anyone that could help you.* \\n \\n*I apologize that this got so long-winded, I fear it's still only the tip of the iceberg. Here's my number: xxxxxxxxxx, call or email me if you need anything, I will get back to you as soon as I find something.* \\n\\n*Please be safe,*\\n\\n*William.* \\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nInitially I was rather pissed that he just sold us the house knowing all this and I was about to give this guy a piece of my mind, but Chris talked me out of it. Seeing as we still kind of need whatever information he has buried in his attic, it's best not to burn any bridges. I shot back a short email, thanking him for reaching out and telling him we really would like to hear more. \\n\\nWhat Chris had told me earlier seemed to be correct, there was definitely more than one. But that only made us wonder, how many more?  \\n\\nThat night Chris and I were really, really scared. We got up to the bedroom, barricaded the door and slept with the lights on, only after checking every nook and cranny of the room.  \\n\\nWhen the sun finally came up we went through the house systematically, in an effort to make sure there were no 'lurkers' left. Luckily, there weren't any, save for the ones we locked in the basement already. And William was right, if you listen closely when it's really quiet, you can hear them sometimes. Pretty freaky. \\n\\nAfter the swoop of the house, we locked all the windows and kept all the doors shut except for going in and out. It was still pretty scary at times, but we'd acquired a certain sense of safety in our little fortress.  \\n\\nIt wasn't until Monday night that we finally heard back from William. This time it was just a text.  \\n\\n------------------------------ \\n*Hello!*  \\n\\n*I hope you're doing okay. I found some interesting things that I reckon will be useful to you both. I'm driving over to your place tomorrow. I'll be there around dinner time.* \\n \\n*See you soon,* \\n\\n*William.* \\n\\n------------------------------ \\n \\nGreat! Right? Except for he never showed. At six he left a message, saying he was in traffic. Then at eight, he still wasn't there. We tried calling but we kept getting his voicemail. We started to get increasingly worried and at about eleven we decided to call the cops. They said there wasn't much they could do at this point, though. The night came and went and we still can't reach him. Chris is about to go the police station, to see if that will get us anywhere. We called the realtor this morning and explained the situation in hopes that he might be able to reach someone closer to William, but so far we haven't heard back from him. \\n\\nI’m really torn, who knows, maybe William never had any intention of coming over. Or maybe he changed his mind. I hope he's alright though. \\n\\nI'll let you all know if anything changes. If anyone has any suggestions, I'm open to anything. Especially in the long term, we are just so screwed. At this point I kind of just want to torch the place. Ah, well.  \\n\\nSee you soon, Reddit.\\n

       "13776   I had started dating online- I decided the chance of meeting my soul mate at a bar or on the street was a one in a million chance, but online at least expanded my horizon. A man who lived nearby who seemed relatively nice offered to go on a date at a restaurant nearby. I agreed. I packed my things into a satchel and was on my way.\\n\\nThe date was nice and he was very polite. Even though I insisted, he still payed for dinner. Everything was going swell- he was walking me home, chatting with me. Then my phone vibrated- I had a text. I ignored it, I was having a good time, I didn't want to seem rude and whip out my phone.\\n\\nWhen we arrived to my apartment, I invited him in for some tea. My phone buzzed several times as I prepared it, so I finally pulled it out to discover 5 new messages from an unknown number. \\n\"Where are you?\"\\n\"You're late.\"\\n\"Did you ditch?\"\\n\"I guess you're not showing up,\"\\n\"I'm just leaving now, okay? If something happened, call me.\"\\n\\nI was confused at first, so I went to the bathroom and sat on the rim of the bathtub and responded, \"Who are you? What are you talking about?\" Nearly a minute later, I got a response. \"I'm xxxx xxxxxx, remember? The guy you promised to meet at a restaurant?\" I was petrified. I heard a knock on the bathroom door. \"Hey, you okay?\" the man in my apartment said.\\n\\nWho was he? How did he know about the date?\\nI called 911 emergency. They haven't arrived yet.\\nNow I sit locked in my bathroom typing this as a madman bangs on the bathroom door.\\n\\nWhat am I supposed to do but wait?

       "43220   I just recently came home for the summer, and tonight my parents are out so I'm alone in the house for the first time in weeks. I've been lying in my bed for an hour or so waiting for sleep to come, but of course it doesn't. I spend far too much time on r/nosleep for that to be an easy task, I guess. So a text from my boyfriend (let's call him Charlie), who I haven't seen in a month, was a welcome distraction from the tedium of being too-awake-to-sleep, too-tired-to-turn-on-light. Our conversation goes like this:\\n\\nCharlie: \"Hello beutiful\"\\n\\nNo kisses, unusual, but I don't tend to read into things too much.\\n\\nMe: \"Hey baby! How are you doing? xxx\"\\n\\nC: \"It's good to see you again\"\\n\\nNow as I mentioned, I haven't seen him in a month. But I am seeing him- FINALLY- on Monday, so I just assume he's drunk or high and made a typo. Easily done, right?\\n\\nM: \"Well yeah, it will be. What are you up to? xxx\"\\n\\nC: \"Im horny. i want you. Bitch.\"\\n\\nThat's a little weird. It's not as though we never exchange sexual messages, but he never calls me bitch. Not in that context, at least. And then it hits me. Charlie lost his phone last week, blackout drunk and stupid. He doesn't have a new one yet, as far as I'm aware, so now I'm a little weirded out. So I call him.\\n\\nAnd I hear a ringtone.\\n\\nAnd it's coming from outside my bedroom door.\\n\\n**UPDATE:** Barricading myself in my room. This is awful.\\n\\n**UPDATE TWO:** MY FUCKING POWER IS OUT. THIS IS NOT A FUCKING JOKE. MY PHONE DIED AND MY POWER IS OUT.\\n\\n[part two] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k4xns/texts_from_my_boyfriend_update/)

       "59587   A little over two weeks ago, my girlfriend, our two dogs and cats and I had all moved into a new construction home. It was on a short street with about 12-13 plots all for new homes being built in the area as part of some new construction groups \"test run.\" Because of this, the homes were lavish, at least to our standards, and cheaper than most other homes of half the quality. At first the price shocked us, but given that we'd been crammed into a 2 bedroom, 900 square ft home with all 4 animals and ourselves with next to no storage space, we were willing to take a plunge and move out to just about anywhere. The new home was about 1,800 square ft, had 3 bedrooms and a bonus room, a backyard big enough for the pups to run around in and enjoy, and most importantly, no neighbors, at least not yet which meant things would be quite. Our last house had been about 2 miles away from the airport and highway, which meant any time of the day we were hearing planes landing and taking off, and 60 mile an hour traffic. Our dogs liked to bark at just about anything, including their shadows and now the only thing we had to worry about was builders in the lots next to ours for the next couple months to finish the new homes, and that was a given when we moved in and something we could handle considering the cost of the home. \\n\\nThe builder met with us personally, laid out his construction plan and assured us the other homes would fill the remaining plots in the next 4-5 months, and since we'd have to deal with the racket, he'd personally cover our HOA fees, make sure his landscapers kept our lawn trimmed, and even gave us the first installation package of a new home security system that just hit the market. I was thrilled about the home security, in large part of past issues I've had with several different break ins. I wasn't taking any chances, and so I made sure I was an expert on the system by the time the realtor left the keys with us on day one. It had one of those robotic voices, you know where it announces, \"front door open,\" or \"garage door open,\" I think you get the picture. A small price to pay for knowing which entry and exit point was being used at any point in time. Of course, like any home security system, the actual alarm that went off was louder than most school fire alarms. I was impressed really. The first few times my girlfriend came home she'd forgotten that it was set and the police stopped by more than once to have a laugh with us about it. They understood the whole new construction thing, new house, new bells and whistles, etc. To top everything off, I could access the alarm system from an app on my phone which made me even more secure, knowing that if we ever left the house and animals unguarded and weren't sure if we'd plugged in the alarm code, I could easily access it from anywhere and make sure things were secure. Here's where things get interesting though, the company behind the alarm system, they were called ZenTeke Security. I hadn't thought of it at first, but aside from the small wire flag in the corner or the front yard and an emblem of ZTS, I couldn't find any actual reference online to them. I searched for a website, a phone number, anything to help in case I ever forgot how to use a certain feature on the system or had to reset the code and couldn't figure it out myself. I got ahold of the home builder one day on my way out the door and he just said that they were relatively unknown still, and so they were still getting everything set up, a web base, direct line, etc. He said they were local, and gave me an address if I ever wanted to go down there, but being on the verge of a final at work for being late, I stuffed the address in my pocket and forgot about it. Any who, moving on to today, and this is where the weird shit started happening. \\n\\nI worked early because of overtime and so I left the house around 8:30am when I usually work the swing shift and don't start until 11am. My girlfriend usually has class on Wednesdays from 1pm-4:30 and then works a few hours at her colleges student union building. She gets home around 7-7:30 and usually we run into each other since it's the same time I'm usually off work. Tonight though, I beat her home and she had worse luck with traffic coming from the opposite side of town. Walking into the new house, I immediately noticed something was off. The dogs hadn't bombarded me through the door like they usually do when we walk in. Instead, I peered from the entry way through the kitchen to the back door and noticed them running around in the backyard. First off, the dogs can't be left outside all day while we're gone because they bark at anything including their shadow. We hadn't wanted ot leave them out to annoy the builders during the day so we'd been keeping them inside. Secondly, the blinds to the backdoor were open, and I always have them closed for privacy, and that went for any blinds in the house. Even living in a new home, my girlfriends still home for part of the days and I don't need any sweaty builders looking to take a break and play peeping tom while my girlfriend roams the house. The last thing that was off, and something I hadn't noticed until I'd taken a few steps into the house was that the floor vents, at least the one right inside the front door entry way and in the living room next to the fire place were flipped open. The new house had hardwood floors and so any air coming out of the vents made for quite an eerie sound. A few more steps inside and the cats came blasting out of the master bedroom. We'd made it clear when we moved in that the cats weren't allowed in there when no one was home because they were still figuring out the new space, and we didn't want them shitting under out bed. My girlfriend was always good about keeping them out when she left for class, and I was never here during the day unless it was Thursday or Friday for my days off. I closed the front door behind me to keep the cats from getting out, and took a quick peak around the house. Call me paranoid, but I even checked the crawl space, the trash cans in the garage and underneath the counter tops to see if someone was by chance, stowed away inside my house. Then it dawned on me, the alarm system hadn't gone off when I came inside. \\n\\nNo \"front door open,\" no \"garage door open,\" and no small chime to remind me to plug in the code and disarm it. I walked back to the entry way where the alarm panel was and woke the touch display. The system read \"armed - silent - delayed - error - call admin.\" I pressed a few more buttons trying to navigate away from the error but nothing on the screen was responding. Just then, my girlfriend came through the door and the alarm went blaring off, full volume and no matter what I pressed on the alarm panel, it wouldn't shut off. The dogs started barking, the cats when crazy and started hissing at the dogs, and my girlfriend and I had our hands covering our ears. Not thinking straight enough thanks to the piercing noise, I bashed my fist against the screen. The noise continued, but the display shut off. My girlfriend motioned to the garage, and went out to flip the breakers. The noise finally stopped a few moments later, but now we had a house without power. We flipped the breakers back over to give the house power, but the alarm came back on. It's been a couple hours now, and it's well passed 9pm. We can't get ahold of the builder to ask him about the alarm system and the crumpled up address in my pocket has bled and smeared on the paper he wrote the it on. We're currently sitting upstairs in our bonus room with a few candles, the pups and the cats, and I just finished sharing everything that happened and what I saw when I first came home, and needless to say, my girlfriend and I are a bit spooked. Thankfully, the one box we have with candles was throw up here since we haven't finished unpacking the miscellaneous shit, and the bonus room has a balcony for me to smoke from. My apologies for any spelling mistakes or grammar, as I've written most of this from my iPhone, and chain smoking cigarettes. As ridiculous as it sounds, we're both a bit too antsy to go downstairs and continue checking things out, and I have a gut feeling we shouldn't leave the bonus room. I'll update tomorrow as soon we get ahold of the builder and hopefully we get things sorted out with the alarm system and weird shit stops happening. \\n\\nOne last thing though, and if anyone else can maybe shed some light on this as home owners too, there's a section of the ceiling in the bonus room that can be lifted up to go into the attic area of the house. Are they supposed to be locked? We had one in our home before, and to my knowledge there shouldn't be a lock on them. I just noticed too that there looks to be a few paint shavings and bits of insulation on the ground beneath it where my girlfriend and I have been sitting, so I know it's been opened before, but there's no way to open it now. We haven't spent a whole lot of time up here since moving in, so maybe the paint chips and insulation have been here all along? Maybe the attics blocked from the inside by a piece of wood that was cut too long in the frame of the house.. I'm just throwing out ideas to make myself feel better I guess. If anyone has better ideas, outside of destroying the ceiling to my house so I can get it open to find out, I'm up for suggestions. \\n\\n-- \\n\\n\\n[Update]: \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I managed to nut up and go downstairs, let the dogs out to piss and searched things pretty well through with a couple flashlights we had stuffed in our \"junk drawer.\" Nothing else seemed out of place aside from the few things I listed above, and she assured me that she had left the blinds closed and the bedroom locked up when she left for class earlier in the day. We secured all the doors and windows, made sure everything was locked up and moved ourselves to the master bedroom, dogs, cats, all of us. We lit some more candles and made sure we even kept a chair against the bedroom door and managed to get some sleep. Aside from the cats playing around all night and knocking some shit off the dresser, the night was relatively normal. \\n\\nWoke up this morning to the dogs barking and the sound of construction next door, and so I got dressed and scoped around outside to find the builder. I saw his truck down the road in front of one of the empty plots, and this was around 8am. He was sitting in the front seat, talking on his phone and yelling at someone, maybe an ex wife or girlfriend. I only say that because I heard something along the lines of, \"you can't keep me from seeing them,\" a few derogatory terms and finally it ended with \"I don't have the child support.\" That's when he saw me approaching his truck. \\n\\nHe quickly changed his tone and greeted me, and I went into what happened with the alarm, not having power all night and wanting to get in touch with the alarm company. He came over, flipped our breakers and all our lights came back on, but no alarm. He opened the front door, and sure as shit, \"front door open.\" I asked him to write down the companies address again and this time I made sure to copy it onto my phone so I wouldn't have to worry about losing it. I didn't mention anything else, I thought that info was better kept to ourselves until we had some more information, and I really wasn't interested in having him in our house any longer than necessary. I just kept getting a bad vibe. My girlfriend still had class today, so I was left with the animals and my thoughts to keep my company, so I made a call to have the locks changed, but they can't come by until later this evening. I scoped the address on google maps and found an empty plot of land. Fancy that, right? Just a vacant block, right between two businesses on the other side of town and on the street view, I could see a sign that even read \"for lease - call (xxx-xxx-xxxx).\" \\n\\nAt this point, I don't have a whole lot else to go on so I'm making a trip to homedepot to invest in some better tools so hopefully get the attic access opened up, and see if maybe anything is up there, or at least any trace of someone recently being there. \\n\\nI'll keep you guys updated as soon as I have more to go off of, and thanks for the advice so far. \\n\\n[Update as of

       "271367  I live on the East Coast, where doesn’t matter. What does is that I live in an area that has the occasional Nor’Easter. For those not in the United States, a Nor’Easter is a major blizzard, which happens in the the northeast (New York, Massachusetts, Maine, etc) But, we haven’t quite gotten one in a while, matter of fact in the time I’ve been alive.  We had a big blizzard the day I was born, Valentine’s Day, but other than that nothing too serious. \\n\\nThat day started out good. I was a straight A student halfway through my first year of high school and I had some really great friends. I was currently , wearing better clothes and looking good. (I was planning on going on a date later that night and wanted to make sure I would look good). Satisfied I changed into school clothes. It wasn’t until I saw the worried look of my mom as I entered the kitchen that I knew something was up. \\n\\n“Listen to this,” she told me, holding out her phone. As she did mine went off. \\n\\n“*All residents of xxx counties and surrounding areas, stay sheltered, we have a major storm warning, I repeat, we have a major storm coming your way. Make sure you have food and water, and a backup generator running. Schools will be closed and get home from work or school*,” Cool I thought. My first Nor’Easter, plus a snow day. Until I heard the odd part of the broadcast, “*Barricade, lock, do whatever you need to do to keep anything out*” \\n\\nOdd, but maybe the they’re worried over trees crashing down? I texted my girlfriend and asked if her family had a generator. She said no, and my parents were friends with her parents so we had them over.\\n\\nAnd then there was more, “*do not undo your locks or barricades if anyone requests to stay during the storms wrath.*” I glanced sideways at my mom who told me dad was on his way home from work, and that the storm was 20 minutes out. We brought everything downstairs in a cellar, accessible with one key we keep hidden. You couldn’t enter without due to the complicated lock system. \\n\\nMy dad arrived shortly followed by my girlfriend and her family about 5 minutes after. We hunkered down, with a crap ton of food, and some games, along with my Xbox and hers (why not, we’ll be here for a while and we have power) combined they were loaded with Fallout 4, Rainbow Six, My girlfriend and I are plat 2, Skyrim, Forza, Halo, and prepared for the long haul. It was almost like a party. Then we heard it. The pelting of hail, and then hard, fast winds. Thinking nothing of it I we ditched the Xbox to play blackjack (we were betting Cheez-Itz and it got pretty serious). \\n\\nAround 11:30, about four hours later, I decided to peep through the cracks of the cellar. And I saw well, *it*. It was a weird black creature. Like a shadow sort of. It looked over my way, but not at me thank god, and I saw it’s face, or what should of been a face. Instead of a face, there were two slits for eyes and a gaping hole for a jaw. I motioned my girlfriend over and she saw it too. We looked at each other before hearing a broadcast. \\n\\n“*Do **not** leave your shelters. The federal government has issued a broader warning area, and it seems to be getting worse*” It didn’t mention the creature. Although I do believe that’s what the government was warning about. All I could think about were the sheer amounts of government facilities that are hiding things like this. I really don’t know, and it’s scary. Then about 3 minutes later I heard it. Footsteps above our cellar. My dog Luna, a beautiful black lab had her fur up, snarling. She never does that. I shushed her and motioned for no one to move. My dad grabbed the rifle we have, and shouldered it. My poor cat was under the tv stand, hair up, eyes wide. \\n\\nIt’s been three hours. The creature has pleaded to be let it in, mimicking my aunt. It crushed me to hear it, but I knew it wasn’t her. They were in Florida with my cousins. Then it let out a horrible wail, sort of a scream, like a mother who lost their child. Then they were gone. The storm continued. \\n\\nPlease if anyone knows what’s going on help. Please.

I don’t like where this is going. Some of your theories are pretty wild (well done), and I don’t know how much of it I even want to document going forward. The support is appreciated. \\n\\n\\nI fell asleep in my car Thursday night after my first post, I was pretty shaken up. When I woke up Friday morning (yesterday) I had dozens of missed calls and texts. A vast majority of them were from Stacy, and she was not happy. She saw me asleep in my car in the morning when she left to take the kids to school. She thought I was drunk from the reunion, and fell asleep in the car. I feel like I really dodged a bullet there, as it bought me a little more time to think clearly before addressing this head on. I know a lot of you recommended I bring it to light immediately, but I need to investigate and come up with a game plan.\\n\\n\\nThere was one text in particular that caught my attention – it was from a number I didn’t recognize:\\n\\n\\n**619-xxx-xxxx:** *Why did you run off so fast last night? There’s something I need to talk to you about, and it’s important. Can we talk?*\\n\\n\\n**I didn’t respond – I’m feeling like I need to be very careful with what I do next**\\n\\n\\nAnyway, I got my shit together and went to work Friday (yesterday), but obviously got nothing done. The only reason I actually went is because I thought the normalcy would help to preserve my sanity throughout the shit storm I was about to endure. \\n\\n\\nI called a couple of my friends that were at the reunion (there aren’t many that I’m actually friends friends with). I nonchalantly asked if they saw Stacy – being careful not to specify which Stacy. Nobody saw her – they asked if we were having issues at home and why I wouldn’t have known if my wife was there / who was watching the kids… etc. So, that was no help. \\n\\n\\nAs kind of an aside, it sounds like there was a bit of commotion at the reunion around somebody that showed up that wasn’t on the original guest list. In fact, her name wasn’t listed in the year book either when they checked – her name was Beth (fyi, I switched this name too for anonymity). She insisted that she had graduated with our class, so they let her in and didn’t put up too much of a fight (especially because so few people from our class actually showed up). Doesn’t sound like she hung around long though. \\n\\n\\nThe calls and texts continued to roll in from my wife, Stacy, throughout the day, and I ignored them. I realized I had three options:\\n\\n\\n**A.)** Bail. This would mean leaving my kids behind. Obviously not really an option at all, as I don’t think there is such a thing as life for me without my kids. \\n\\n \\n**B.)** Confront her in some way – share what I’m going through / explain everything.\\n\\n\\n**C.)** Play it all off until I can gather more info to make a solid decision.\\n\\n\\nI’m going with C. If I don’t rock the boat, I’ll be able to coast a little longer without any permanent impact on my life. That is unless my wife has knowledge beyond what I know or has plans to kill me. If she’s logical in any way still, I don’t think this is a real threat. If it is, then I have to give her kudos because she has moved mountains, and stars have aligned to pull this thing off. \\n\\n\\nSince I’m rolling with the path of least resistance – I decided it would be best to go with the story that she already believed to be true. This would mean telling her that I drank too much at the reunion. One drink lead to several, I drove home like an asshole, and I fell asleep in my car. We all know that this is not what happened (and I don’t condone drinking and driving) but it seemed like it was easier to go with this than it would be to make up another story and sell her on it. \\n\\n\\nWhen I got home, she had dinner ready like she normally does. She and I spoke briefly about everything in private, and I confirmed what happened the night before / why I was in the car. She was disappointed, I pretended to be ashamed and embarrassed, all was okayish. \\n\\n\\nWhen we sat down for dinner with the kids, she asked me a little more about the actual reunion. I played it cool, and told the story exactly as it happened – everything up until the piece where Stacy tapped me on the shoulder at the reunion. It’ll be much easier to keep all of this straight if I keep it as close to the truth as possible. I have no idea what she knows, I have no idea if there are others involved or what. So, I want to minimize the opportunities for getting caught in a lie. \\n\\n\\nI’m getting the impression that she doesn’t really think anything is up. I’m pretty good at staying cool under pressure; however, I am a bit nervous. Based on her responses and body language, I suspect that she probably wrote it off in her own mind as a result of the drinking and driving incident (i.e. me feeling ashamed/embarrassed). \\n\\n\\nThis is good – things are kind of coasting along, and it feels like I can ride this out and keep digging as long as I’m careful. \\n\\n\\nI went to bed shortly after dinner. I obviously didn’t sleep well in the car, and things were still a bit hazy so I felt like this was best. \\n\\n\\nThis brings us to today. So, I woke up this morning, and felt pretty good about everything. I feel normal. If I wanted I could legitimately pretend like I never saw Stacy at the reunion, and I think life would continue on as it did beforehand. At least, that’s the vibe I’m getting from everyone around me (nobody close to me is really asking weird questions). \\nThat said – I’m going to dig because I want to know more. I went ahead and finally responded to that text this morning…\\n\\n\\n**619-xxx-xxxx:** *Why did you run off so fast last night? There’s something I need to talk to you about, and it’s important. Can we talk?*\\n\\n\\n**Me:** *Hey, what do you mean? Who is this?*\\n\\n\\n**I figured it would be better to play dumb and fish for information before divulging anything that could be potentially damaging to my situation.**\\n\\n\\nI’m still waiting on the reply now. I have no idea what happens from here. If they don’t respond, maybe I just go back to living life the way I was and forget any of this ever happened.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n[Part

       "143667  I created a throwaway account to post this.  I'm so scared and so paranoid, I don't want to run the risk of anyone being able to identify me.  I hope you all understand.\\n\\n\\nI’m scared.  I’ve watched scary movies and read scary stories my entire life, but nothing compares to the real thing.  The way your stomach bottoms out or your hands tremble.  The way your mind goes quiet and you become paralyzed.  The moment when you think that you are about to die.  That’s real fear.  And that fear has nothing on the way your heart races when something makes you jump in a movie.  Because this is real. \\n\\n\\nLet me rewind a bit, and I’ll go ahead and apologize if this is too long.  If it is, you don’t have to read it, just knowing that it’s out there and someone may read it comforts me enough. \\nI just moved into a new apartment about a month ago with my two best friends for my senior year of college.  Let’s call them Becky and Gary.  I stayed in my hometown and commuted to a small university for my college career, and I finally decided I needed to get out on my own.  \\n\\n\\nWhen we were moving, we all joked about how unfortunate it would be if we moved into a haunted apartment.  We all spent the first few weeks semi-paranoid.  We would hear noises in the night, but we ultimately chalked it up to our noisy upstairs neighbors and our nocturnal cats.  Either way, I was generally uneasy most of that time.  Staying up at night reading [r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/) stories didn’t help much either.\\n\\n\\nOne day Becky came home from work.  We both waitressed at a local Italian place, but I was off that night.  She was creeped out and explained to us about a strange man she had at her table.  This man knew a little too much about Becky.  He knew her height and weight, her birthday, her astrological sign, and he kept trying to get her to meet him later.  We thought it was weird, but we popped open a bottle of wine and laughed about it.  We figured it was a coincidence.\\n\\n\\nBut a couple nights ago I got a strange message.  Becky was at work, and I was at home doing homework when my phone buzzed.  I looked at it, and it was from a number I didn’t know:\\n\\n\\nxxx-xxx-xxxx: *Are your doors locked?*\\n\\n\\nI had just updated my phone, and when my phone restarts none of my contacts are registered for a few minutes.  I just figured this was my mom.  She was always telling me to lock my doors (she spends a lot of time watching Investigation Discovery).  And yes, I’m ashamed to admit that I rely a little too much on technology and I don’t have my mom’s number memorized.  I got out of bed and went to check my front door, and it was locked.  I texted back to say yes, and the response was immediate:\\n\\n\\nxxx-xxx-xxxx: *How Aquarius of you to check.*\\n\\n\\nMy blood ran cold.  My mom didn’t know anything about astrology.  I didn’t know what to do.  I thought about calling to police, but I decided against it.  We had told all of our friends about Becky’s weird experience at work, so I just figured it was one of them messing with me.  So I texted back.  This is the exchange between me and the unknown number.\\n\\n\\nMe: *Lol, is this Janice?*\\n\\n\\nX: *You might want to tell your friend to be careful walking to her car tonight.*\\n\\n\\nMe: *This really isn’t funny.  Who is this?*\\n\\n\\nX: *I’m not laughing*\\n\\n\\nMe: *I’m calling the police*\\n\\n\\nX: *Good luck.*\\n\\n\\nIf it was just a joke, the threat of police would have made one of my friends fess up.  I paced around my living room, trembling.  I didn’t know what to do.  If I was reading or watching this, I would be screaming at the character to stop being stupid and just call the police!  It wouldn’t hurt even if it was just a prank.  But I realized in that moment that it’s a lot different when it’s real life.  When it’s your life.\\n\\n\\nI jumped when I heard a key turning in the lock.  Becky opened the door.  She looked white as a sheet.  She slammed the door behind her and locked the door.  She leaned against the door and looked at me.  Tears were shining in her eyes.\\n\\n\\n“Why are you home so early?” I asked.  It was only 8.  She shouldn’t have been home for another couple hours.\\n\\n\\n“A random number texted me.”\\n\\n\\nMy heart was racing.  “What did they say?”  She shook her head and just handed me her phone.  My stomach sank as I read the text message:\\n\\n\\n*Be careful not to slip on your roommate’s blood when you walk in.*\\n\\n\\nWe didn’t know what to think. We wanted to believe it was just a sick joke, but it didn’t make the fear any less real.  We slept together in my room that night.  Becky had fallen asleep, and I was still up watching Law and Order.  I noticed my blinds were raised slightly, so I got up to close them.  I was still getting used to the new apartment, so I accidentally pulled them the wrong way, causing the blinds to raise.  I quickly shut them, but not before I saw what I swore was a person standing at the edge of the trees.  Looking right at me.\\n\\n\\nThe next few days passed without incident.  I would have thought it was only just a dream if I didn’t have Becky to verify the events.  But, still, the past few day have been quiet, and I think we were starting to believe that we were safe.  Maybe it was just a joke.  It wasn’t until today that I have realized how sick this person really is.\\n\\n\\nI went to my mom’s house to watch the football games.  We were broke college kids who didn’t want to pay for cable, so I spent every Saturday that I wasn’t at work at my mom’ house, taking advantage of her all-access cable.  My team’s game came on around 7, so I was at her house until about 11 at night.  She wasn’t there because she worked nights, all of my siblings moved away years ago, and Becky was at work.  So, I was alone with some wings enjoying the game.\\n\\n\\nAround 9 o’clock I started to hear what sounded like a growling.  I paused the TV, and it stopped just seconds after.  I was sitting in a recliner right next to the sliding glass doors leading to the backyard.  One of the doors was covered with blinds, but the other door was not.  The blinds had fallen about a year ago, and we never got around to replacing them.  I looked out the door, but I didn’t see anything.  I chalked it up to being my neighbor’s dog, and got on with my football game.\\n\\n\\nBut it kept happening.  Every time I would pause the TV, it would stop.  It wasn’t coming from the TV, but I didn’t know what it was.  Within the next 10 or so minutes, it sounded like the growling was coming from both the front and the back yard.  I chose to just ignore it, turning up the volume, and eventually, it went away.\\n\\n\\nI left as soon as the game ended, and my team had won, so I was euphoric.  When I got outside to my car, I noticed a piece of paper stuck under my windshield wiper.  My neighbors frequently left me notes on my car when I was visiting, as not to bother me, saying how they missed me and hoped I was doing well and if I needed anything etc., so I didn’t think this was weird.  I grabbed the piece of paper and got into my car. I opened the note to see which neighbor it was from.  My blood started pounding in my ears as I read the note:\\n\\n\\n*Are you scared yet?*\\n\\n\\nIt only took a few seconds for my fear to transform into anger.  I didn’t take lightly to someone trying to bully me into feeling scared.  I started to consider all of this less sinister, and think of it more of just a prick trying to get a rise out of two young girls.  I crumpled the note and threw it to my floorboard.\\n\\n\\nWhen I got back home, Becky still wasn’t home from work.  I milled about in the living room for a while.  I ate a hot pocket and watched an episode of Dawson’s Creek.  I tried waiting up, but it was becoming harder and harder to keep my eyes open.  Becky finally texted me around 12:30 and said she had gotten off but was going to grab her shift beer.  She invited me, but I was too tired to go.  I told her to come in my room and let me know when she got home.\\n\\n\\nWhen I walked into my room, my bed was made.  I’m not someone who usually makes their bed, but if my door is open, and Becky sees it, she will usually make it for me.  My room was spotless actually.  I needed to remember to thank Becky when she got home.  There was a piece of paper on my pillow, and I sat down, eager to read a sweet note from my friend.\\n\\n\\n*What about now?*\\n\\n\\nI threw the note on my nightstand with trembling hands.  Had this person been in my apartment?  Had he been in my room?  I quickly checked under my bed and in my closet, but I was comforted to find that no one else was in the room.  I quickly texted Becky to thank her for making my bed.\\n\\n\\nShe texted back immediately: “Lol I didn’t.  But you’re welcome!”\\n\\n\\nI was finding it hard to breathe.  I responded that it must have been our other roommate, but I knew that it wasn’t.  I laid down, in tears, wondering why this was happening to us.  I was surprised to open my eyes to daylight.  It felt like only a few minutes had passed, but I guess I had fallen asleep.  \\n\\n\\nI went into the living room, and there was no sign of anyone up.  Weird.  Becky was always up before me.  I walked to her room and knocked on the door.  No answer.  I opened the door, and she wasn’t there.  Her bed was still made, and her fairy lights were still on from the night before.  I checked my phone to see if she had gone to the store or on a run.  I had two texts from her but they were both from the night before.\\n\\n\\n*12:57 A.M. - On the way home, bub*\\n\\n\\n*1:05 A.M. - He is herhuy769o8293*\\n\\n\\nI don’t think Becky ever made it home last night.\\n\\n\\nIf anyone out there is reading this, I'll update you if I can.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: for grammar

       "184100  It’s been three days since it happened. My hands are finally steady enough to type my story out. The police officers involved in this case were kind enough to allow me to type out my testimony. I don’t think I could retell the story in a court room, not with her there. I’m also not sure if it’s illegal or not to share this online, but I’m doing it. If there is any way that I can prevent this from happening again, to protect anyone from experiencing what I saw, I’d happily take the risk.\\n\\nI may as well start from the beginning:\\n\\nI’m a VERY broke college student and any easy money opportunities are few and far between. I was off for the summer at home and looking for odd jobs. One day, I received a letter in the mail box. There was no return address, just a stamp, my name, and my address. I sat down at the kitchen table, tearing the envelope open with an embarrassingly intense curiosity. \\n\\nA small newspaper clipping fluttered out onto the table. Checking the inside of the envelope, I was disappointed to find that there was nothing else. I picked up the clipping. It looked old and worn, like someone had spent a good amount of time sitting and rubbing it over with their thumb. On one side was a piece of an indiscernible picture. On the other was an ad, like one out of a classified listing. It was a wanted ad for a house keeper. There wasn’t much written, just that someone was needed on weekends and the pay was a decent hourly wage. On the bottom of the paper, there was a phone number. \\n\\nI sat back in my chair. I might as well call. The ad might have been old, but if it ended up in my mailbox, it’s likely that the ad poster was still searching for someone to fill the position. Looking back between my phone and the clipping, I dialed the number. \\n\\nOn the third ring, someone picked up. It was an older woman. I was almost shocked that someone answered.\\n“Hello?”\\n\\n“Uh, yes. Hello. I’m calling about the ad you put out in the paper for a house keeper?” The lady on the other end seemed to pause.\\n\\n“Ah. Oh, yes. Of course. I’m just looking for someone to watch the house while I’m away, and take care of my plants.”\\n\\n“Is the position still open?”\\n\\n“Yes, it is. How about you come over later today and I’ll explain the details?”\\n\\nI agreed and she gave me an address. It seemed like too good of an opportunity to pass up. When I arrived at her house later, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. She had a lovely white house with a long driveway lined with fir trees. It was like something out of a magazine. As I drove further up, I could see the shape of the woman bent over in a garden. I parked my car and approached her. I cleared my voice so I didn’t frighten her. She looked up and motioned for me to come forward. The lady stood and gesture to her plants. \\n\\n“This is my garden. My life’s work. It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”\\n\\nI nodded in agreement. It was beautiful. The garden seemed to wrap around one side of the house. Great tall oak trees bordered the outside with leaves that had just began to darken. Where the garden met the house, thick patches of ivy sprouted out of the ground and curled up the side and around the brick chimney. Hues of dark red speckled my view as I noticed the rose bushes. They were almost taller than me. The roses on them were breath-taking, shining in the sun-lit dew like bright rubies.\\n\\nI looked back her. “You did all this?”\\n\\n“Yes, and it takes quite a bit of work to keep it. Come, let’s go inside and I’ll tell you more.”\\n\\nI studied her as she led me in. The way she looked was strange. There was no way she was older than fifty, but the years appeared to be hard on her face and voice. Yet, at the same time, she had a large build that made me think she could throw me over her head. We sat down in a kitchen that rivaled any from Home and Garden’s. She offered me a cup of tea.\\n\\n“Now, down to business.” She said.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t usually need someone to take care of my house of plants, but unfortunately, my sister-in-law has recently passed. My brother is in no shape to handle this on his own.”\\n\\nThe woman sipped on her drink.\\n\\n“This weekend I need to drive there to go to the funeral and I need someone to watch the house. I’m sure this will not be a re-occurring thing, but who knows. I could always use the help.”\\n\\n“This is why I need someone else’s help, someone who I can count on.” She paused.\\n\\n“Can I count on you Alex?”\\n\\n“Uh… yeah, of course.” I was slightly thrown off that she already knew me, but then I settled down. She could have known my mom or anyone who knew I was open to odd jobs.\\n\\n“Um, by the way, what’s your name?” I swallowed, surprised that I had shown up to a complete stranger’s house without knowing their name.\\n\\n“Margaret. So, I take it you accept?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nMargaret told me everything that she expected to be done. She told me that if I was finished with my job, then I could do whatever I pleased as long as I stayed at the house. A few days later, Margaret called me to come house sit. By the time I arrived, she was already gone. Margaret had said she kept a spare key away in case I came at a time like this. I lifted a porcelain garden gnome near the front porch. Sure enough, a brass key sparkled back up at me. \\n\\nThe inside of the house was darkened from the overcast outside, but with a flick of the wrist the house was bathed in a warm glow. I got to work, setting up the sprinkler system and various plant foods. I walked back out into the garden, still amazed by the roses. I chuckled as the Alice and Wonderland stories came to mind. It was only a matter of time before my chores were finished. When I returned inside, I wondered if there was something else that needed done. If I did nothing else that night, then that’s what Margaret would be paying for. \\nMost of the house was spotless, except for the kitchen counter and sink. Since I wanted to impress Margaret, I scrubbed the counter and sprayed some cleaner into the sink. I reached for the spray nozzle. The nozzle only came a few inches from where it sat. I pulled again, but it didn’t come out further.\\n\\nAnnoyed, I opened the cabinet under the sink. The hose wrapped itself around a pipe underneath. I reached my hand under, knocking over several cans and bottles of cleaner. Cursing under my breath, I set each one back up. The last one, however, kept falling over. I picked it up, wanting to toss it through the window, but my eyes caught the glint of small metal ring. \\n\\nMy finger wrapped itself around it. I pulled and was surprised when the whole bottom of the cabinet shifted up, sending cans of cleaner clattering onto the kitchen floor. My gaze returned to my hand. It held what I now recognized as a handle of sorts connected to what once was the cabinet floor. I gazed down at the hole that I had uncovered, gagging as the smell of mold wafted its way up. There was obviously some kind of water leakage. \\nIf I knew anything about it, mold was nothing to mess with. I sighed. I knew I couldn’t just put the cabinet floor back on and act like nothing ever happened. I pulled out my phone, calling Margaret, but my actions were interrupted by distant noise. A low moan. I looked deep into the black precipice. My heart doubled its pace in the silence after. The sound was soft and distant, and for a moment I thought it was the floor creaking or my imagination. Then, I heard it again. I wondered to myself if there was an animal stuck down there. \\n My hunch was confirmed when I recognized the stench of stale piss mixed with the smells from down below. For a moment, I sat and contemplated. The feeling of guilt surged up from within me, replacing the feeling of fear.\\nNow, I wish I would have just left, ran away. I wish I was a person who could let some stray mutt die.\\nI sighed again, dawning one of the painting masks that were now laying on the kitchen floor. Turning on my phone’s flashlight, I shined it into the hole. I discovered that it wasn’t just a hole, it looked like a tunnel that led off somewhere. Letting my feet sink into the hole. The spongy earth pushed back against my feet. I edged myself in to crawl along the floor of the tunnel. Even though claustrophobia was not usually a problem for me, the sensation of wet soil on my back made me feel like a cornered animal.\\n\\nFortunately, once I was in a few feet, the hole grew surprisingly roomy. It was almost as if it was meant for a person to go through. I wondered if this was not a hole, but instead some unfinished basement or cellar. Soon enough, I didn’t need to crawl. I wiped the black filth off my knees as I stood.\\n\\nI was now in an open space, vaguely in the shape of a small room. I looked around. The thing that caught my eye and the light of my phone was a large metal door. The only sound was my feet patting against the dirt floor as I approached the door. I pressed my ear against it and pieces of rust flaked onto my skin. From the other side, I heard the faint moans again, except this time closer. Another sound caught my ear. Mumbling and crying? A cold shock of fear rang through my body like an alarm. I wanted to leave. I wanted to run until I couldn’t and never look back, but some part of me couldn’t turn away. That same part of me urged my hand toward the door.\\nI grabbed the door handle, turning it. The metal grinding on metal let out a hideous squeal. The moans and cries from inside silenced. I creaked the door ajar, but still everything inside was quiet. A violet light leaked through the doorway, turning my white shirt a phosphorescent blue. I quickly turned off my phone flash light. Why were black lights down there? The thought turned over in my head and I only grew more confused. \\n\\nIn the dim light, I noticed something else. Cages. Tens of them along the floor, all old and rusted as the door I had come through. I stood still, when I heard nothing I turned my phone’s light back on. Behind the bars of the cages I could see eyes reflecting back at me.\\n\\nI stepped closer towards one of the cages and shined my light within. Whatever was in there tried to scurry away, but it couldn’t get far. I focused on it. It was a boy, cowering in the corner and covering his face.\\n\\n“Oh my god. A kid?” A horrible feeling settled in my stomach. I hurried to unlatch the cage. There was a large rusty padlock stopping me. Pulling out my pocket knife, I picked at the lock until it gave way. I swung open the door and motioned for him to come out. \\n\\n“Come on, let’s get you out of here.” The boy remained motionless but spoke, his voice was weak and horse.\\n\\n“I can’t, none of us can.”\\n\\n“Us?” I shined the light in the other cages. He was right, several more silhouettes were huddled in corners.\\n“Why can’t you leave?”\\n\\nThe boy only pointed towards his legs. A wave of nausea washed over me as I looked down. His legs were horribly emaciated, like those of a holocaust survivor. But the thing that made me want to vomit wasn’t his malnourished legs. Thick roots snaked around his ankles and under his skin. The roots sat under his flesh like nightmarish leeches, pulsating every few seconds. My eyes followed the roots as they lead back towards the ceiling of the large room. Near the top, the roots were covered with thorns and small red buds. I reached to pluck one off, crushing it open. Underdeveloped red petals sat in the palm of my hand. A horrible realization came to mind. \\n\\n“The rose bushes. They’re eating you.” \\n\\nThe horror of what I had saw slowly gave way to a burning anger.\\n\\n“Margaret.” The name seethed out of my teeth.\\n\\nI turned back to the boy. I opened my phone and hit record.\\n \\n“My name is Alex xxxxxx, I live at xxxxxx on xxxx street.” I turned toward the boy. “What is your name?”\\n\\n“My name is Henry.”\\n\\n“How long have you been kept here Henry?”\\n\\n“i-I don’t know. There are no clocks. There’s no sunlight. It could have been years.”\\n\\n“How... old are you?”\\n\\n“I’m nine.” I looked at his face, even with the malnutrition, I could tell that he should be about twelve or thirteen. \\n\\n“I’m sorry, I don’t know.” His voice even cracked like he was going through puberty.\\n\\nI stood up and walked around, recording the other cages. There were other kids, some much younger than Henry, some looked almost sixteen. Most of them cowered away when I approached, one sat still, face down. Part of me worried that she was dead. \\n\\nI opened my mouth to say more, but froze when I heard the sound of gravel at the end of the driveway. “Shit.” I tucked my phone away and went back to Henry. “Look, I’m going to get you out of here, all of you.” I closed the cage door and relocked it. \\n\\nI hurried to close the rusted door behind me. I glanced one more time at the cages before I scurried up the tunnel. I managed to place the bottom of the cabinet and the chemicals back in place before I heard the keys jingling in the front door. In through the door way came the not-so innocent Margaret who pulled a large suitcase behind her. I suppressed a shudder when I thought of who or what she could have put in there. \\n\\nShe looked toward me and smiled. “So, how did everything go?”\\n\\nI put on the best fake smile I could manage. “Everything went well, I got the plants watered and everything like you asked. Besides that, nothing else really happened.”\\n\\nMargaret looked down at my knees. “What happened to your pants dear?”\\n\\nMy heart skipped a beat as I thought of an excuse. “There was some crab grass sprouts growing around one of the rose bushes, so I pulled them out. I did it after I watered the rose bushes, so my pants got a little muddy.”\\n“Oh? Well you didn’t have to ruin your pants for me, but I appreciate the effort. Maybe you can help me in the future? It would be nice to go out more often, get the little things I need.”\\n\\n“Of course.” I lie through my teeth. In reality, I’d never wanted anything more than to be away from her. I grab what I had brought with me and began to leave.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t think you’re leaving now.” \\n\\nCold sweat builds on my forehead as I tried to think of a response. Without turning around, I responded. “What?”\\n\\n“I forgot to give you your check, silly.” She took her time getting her check book and writing a check. Seconds turned to hours, but she eventually handed me the check. At that moment, it was nothing more than a piece of paper to me. I turned to leave, and that time she didn’t stop me.\\n\\nMy car flew down the driveway, sending sticks and bits of gravel into the wind behind me. I drove as fast as I could to the nearest police station. I was greeted by a brunette police officer with a tired look in her eyes. But, by the time I was done talking to her, and she had seen the video, the officer seemed a bit more awake. I excluded the part about the roots, in case she thought this was some prank. \\n\\nWithin half an hour, a whole group of police officers had arrived at the station to question me. I told them everything I knew and soon enough they were out the door. The sirens on their cars wailed down the street and the flashing blues and reds faded into the distance. \\n\\nI’d like to say that it was a happy ending, because for the most part, it was. The kids got sent to the hospital and I had the chance to visit Henry in the hospital. Margaret was incarcerated and I’m back home, sitting safe and sound on my computer. However, there is one thing that continues to nag at me. At no time did the officer’s question me about the rose bushes, there was never any mention of it. Apparently, there were no traces of the roots in Henry’s or any of the other children’s legs. The fact that nobody mentioned it bothers me a lot. \\n\\nEarlier today, I drove up to an empty field beside Margaret’s house. I peeked through the oak trees, looking. But no matter how hard I looked, I couldn’t see the rose bushes. I squinted and even zoomed in on the house with my phone’s camera. They were gone. \\n

       "24263   I am utterly amazed by how popular this has become. I’ve taken the advice of many of you and did not post again until the rest was all written out. \\n\\nSo, fair warning, this is really, REALLY long, but it’s also the last part of the story.\\n\\nI tried to answer some comments earlier, when I was at lunch and didn’t have time to write the rest of this out, but I’ll go back and try to reply to everything else now that this is finished.\\n\\nPart One: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zx5up/8th_grade_math/\\n\\nPart Two: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zxxxk/8th_grade_math_2/\\n\\nI wish I could tell you that things improved over Christmas break, but they only got worse. The first night of Christmas break I went to sleep only to have the most bizarre nightmare of my life. In the dream, Pedersen was just standing there in the same tacky suit he always wore. He just kept shouting “Punishment!”\\n\\nThe thing is, it wasn’t like a normal shout… it was like a screech. Very loud, very shrill. I woke up almost immediately and I was terrified. It took nearly an hour to get back to sleep, and as soon as I did, I had the same nightmare. Needless to say, I didn’t sleep that night.\\n\\nSince I couldn’t sleep, I went out to the living room to play some SNES and calm my nerves. My dogs – I had two Labradors – instinctively followed me and sat on the couch on either side of me. I just sat there in the dark, playing Super Mario World with the sound muted so I wouldn’t wake my parents.\\n\\nNow, our living room had a big front window. It took up a pretty good deal of the wall, and gave a great view of the yard and the street out front. At night we’d always keep the curtain drawn. Suddenly, both of my dogs jump off the couch and rush over to the window. They kinda pushed under the curtain and just started barking and hopping up on the window with their front paws on the glass.\\n\\nI had no idea what was going on. My chocolate lab liked to go out through the doggy door to our backyard and bark, but they never just went to the window and barked like this. I ran over to the window and looked out to see what was happening.\\n\\nThere was a pick-up truck parked in the middle of the street, right in front of my house. It looked a lot like Pedersen’s truck. I couldn’t see the driver, but it was enough to freak me out. Naturally my parents came out of their room pretty quick, and they were pissed to me awake in the middle of the night playing games.\\n\\nI freaked out and tried to tell them that there was a truck parked in front of our house. My dad looked out the window, since my dogs WERE freaking out. But the truck was gone. I guess it drove away when I turned to see my parents.\\n\\nThat was the beginning of the really unsettling stuff. I was freaked out.\\n\\nI didn’t sleep that night. I just tossed and turned. The next day I met Jamal at a pizza hut that was within bike riding distance of our neighborhood. Our plan was to get some pizza and head back to his house and talk about all of the weird stuff. I told him about seeing who I thought was Pedersen outside.\\n\\nAs we were leaving, I suddenly felt a lot of pressure on my knee. It was like someone was squeezing it, and naturally I went down quick. Landed face first in the pizza and cursed up a storm. As Jamal helped me back up, that’s when we saw him. Pedersen was in his pick up, parked on the other side of the parking lot and staring at us with that same cold, seething stare.\\n\\nOf course, I’d already hurt my knee the other day, so at this point it wouldn’t be a stretch to think I was just overexerting my injury… but I swear to you, it felt like there was a hand grabbing my knee and squeezing it.\\n\\nI ended up going home, staying in bed all day with my leg up and ice on my knee. The nightmares came back that night, and the next night. By the time Christmas break was over, there had only been a few nights when I actually slept. Christmas Eve and Christmas I was able to sleep through, and for a few days the nightmares only happened once or twice, but for the majority of our time off school, I had the nightmares.\\n\\nWhen school started up again, I was surprised to see Bethany was back. She didn’t say a word to me all day, until lunch when she got me and Jamal to follow her into one of the bathrooms. The three of us hid in the bathroom stall and we soon found out Bethany had been having the same nightmares we had.\\n\\nBethany was convinced that Pedersen was responsible for everything. Have to admit, the way she explained it… it was creepy. Jamal stole his gameboy back, and then Jamal’s gameboy gets broken. I fake a knee injury to distract him so Jamal can steal the gameboy, and then I start suffering real knee injuries. Not to mention Bethany’s mom yells at him embarrasses him at his job… and she dies in a car accident.\\n\\nOf course, Pedersen hadn’t actually done anything. The most he ever did was just stare at us.\\n\\nBethany was convinced he had caused it all somehow. At this point, I believed her. Too much weird stuff had happened. Right as we’re in the middle of this discussion, someone knocks on the stall door. I swear I hadn’t heard anyone enter the bathroom.\\n\\nWith three sets of legs under the stall, it was pretty obvious that something unusual was happening, but we thought we might be able to just stay quiet and keep the door locked. Suddenly the door opened. Jamal later swore to me that he had locked it, and I believe him.\\n\\nI’m sure it comes as no surprise that Pedersen was on the other side of the door. He stared at us, and then he just kind of smiled and said we were all in a lot of trouble.\\n\\nWell, we were. Two boys and a girl – all known “troublemakers” -- caught in a bathroom stall instead of being at lunch? The principal just assumed something sexual was happening. Schools are pretty strict about that stuff, and we all got in a lot of trouble.\\n\\nWe were all suspended for two weeks. I got lucky that my dad didn’t get to mad. He assumed that I was a curious 14 year old, and really the worst of my punishment was having to have the sex talk again, and him telling me not to do that kind of stuff at school.\\n\\nJamal wasn’t so lucky. His mom freaked out and grounded him, no phone, no leaving the house. \\n\\nBethany? Well, her dad was already a wreck. He took her mom’s death really hard, and when he heard why she was suspended, and that it involved Jamal and I (who had become frequent guests at her place over Christmas Break), he just assumed that we were trying to take advantage of her grief. We were forbidden from going over there and worse yet, I found out Bethany’s dad decided to move to Virginia, and they were going to leave immediately.\\n\\nWell, immediately meant a couple weeks, but that was still really fast to just up and move. So I spent the next two weeks at home, hanging out with the neighbor kids. I didn’t tell them about any of what was happening, doubted they’d believe me anyway.\\n\\nOne of my neighbors was named Matt. We’d hang out on occasion. We weren’t super close, but Matt’s dad was a big computer guy, so Matt had a lot of really cool games and although it makes me sound terrible, I pretty much hung out with him to play with his stuff. I know, but I was 14, and I admit I was an asshole.\\n\\nI was hanging at Matt’s house one day. It was after school hours, although I was still suspended. It was my turn to play on the computer, so Matt goes to walk his dog. While he’s gone, I get up to use the bathroom, and suddenly my knee gives out. I feel the same squeezing sensation I felt at the pizza hut.\\n\\nI fell into the table, knocked over his computer monitor. I ended up banging up my left arm pretty badly, and breaking the monitor. Matt comes back and he freaks out. Starts yelling at me, he’s pissed that I broke his dad’s computer. I explained it was an accident, but he didn’t care. He kicked me out and told me to expect his dad would be by my place when he got home.\\n\\nSo I walking home (Matt lived only one street over), and then I see him. Pedersen. He’s sitting at the end of the street in his pick up and staring at me. And I knew. I knew that somehow, as strange as it sounds, he was making my knee hurt. He was squeezing my knee somehow without ever actually physically touching me.\\n\\nI freaked. I’d have to walk right by him to get home. I waited for him to leave, but he didn’t. He just sat there on the side of the road, staring at me. After ten minutes of this, I turned and just walked down another street. I didn’t know where I was going, I just wanted to be away from him. I knew that if I got near his truck, something bad was going to happen.\\n\\nI couldn’t get to Jamal’s house, since he lived on the other side of me. I decided to try to get to Bethany’s. If you recall, she lived further than the neighborhood where Jamal and I lived. It wasn’t terribly far, but I was used to riding my bike down there. I’d never walked that far before, especially not in pain.\\n\\nSomehow I made it. Twice along the way I thought I saw Pedersen’s truck behind me, but he’d turn down a side street whenever I turned around. I don’t have words to describe how scared I was. I was hurt, alone, it was getting dark and my teacher was stalking me and I was convinced he had the power to hurt me without ever touching me. And I should point out; I did not have a cell phone. I didn’t get one of those until I started college. So I had no way to contact my family, or the police, or anyone.\\n\\nI made it to Bethany’s house, and by the time I did it was dark outside. I knew Bethany’s dad had forbidden me from coming over, but to my relief when I got there his car was gone. I knocked on the door and Bethany answered.\\n\\nI told her what happened, and that I was pretty sure Pedersen was following me. She asked what I wanted to do, if we should call the police, but I knew they wouldn’t believe us. We were a couple of fourteen years old, known troublemakers, on suspension and everyone assumed she was acting out over her mom’s death.\\n\\nEven if we’d be honor roll students, would the cops believe that a teacher was somehow hurting me without ever touching me? \\n\\nBethany told me that they were moving soon. She was in tears, saying she couldn’t believe Pedersen was going to just get away with all of this. I told her I’d do whatever I could… but I didn’t know what I could do. He was a teacher. Sure, nobody liked him, but he still had more credibility than I did.\\n\\nI called my dad, had him pick me up. He was pissed. Both because he knew I wasn’t supposed to be at Bethany’s house, and because Matt’s dad had called. Now I was in trouble, and I spent the rest of my suspension grounded\\n\\nThe nightmares kept coming. Some nights they wouldn’t come and I’d sleep okay… but most nights I only got at most, three hours of sleep. Not three hours in a row, but three hours total. The rest was the nightmares and trying to go back to sleep.\\n\\nBy the time my suspension was over, I was a wreck. Bethany had moved away, Jamal was keeping his distance too. I guess his parents told him to stay away from me because they blamed me for getting him in trouble.\\n\\nSo I was alone, really. With so little sleep my grades were falling. I started drinking copious amounts of soda for the caffeine since I wasn’t sleeping well, and that made me start gaining a lot of weight. I sort of became a lone, not talking to anyone, barely paying attention in class.\\n\\nBy February, it was obvious something was wrong with me. My parents assumed I was struggling in school, and turns out the school started worrying about my home life. Mr. Hall, my science teacher, eventually had me go to his office at lunch. He asked me what was wrong, but I brushed it off.\\n\\nThat’s when he asked me a question that made my jaw drop.\\n\\n“Does this have anything to do with Mr. Pedersen?”\\n\\nI can’t really describe what that moment was like. Like I said, I never thought of telling anyone about Pedersen, since I didn’t think anyone would believe me. Now, I had an adult – my beloved science teacher – asking me if Pedersen was part of the problem.\\n\\nSo I just nodded. I wasn’t about to tell him that I thought Pedersen had been harrassig me for months, or that I thought he had some kind of power to hurt me from long distances, or that I thought he had somehow killed Bethany’s mother.\\n\\nMr. Hall got this odd look on his face. He kept staring at me. After what seemed like an eternity, he finally told me that I should go to his house after school. That it wasn’t safe to talk here, but we could talk there.\\n\\nBefore everything with Pedersen, I would have been weirded out by a teacher asking me to their house… but if there was even a chance that Mr. Hall could help, I had to try it. I was alone and miserable and I needed help. \\n\\nAfter school, I met him in the parking lot and went with him to his house. On the way, I thought I saw Pedersen’s pick up behind us, but when I tried to tell Hall he just shushed me and told me not to talk.\\n\\nI have to admit, I was terrified. Mr. Hall was a big guy. He had been in the army when he was younger and he looked like he could still fight if he wanted to. When we got to his house, he ushered inside and took me into his living room. \\n\\nHe sat down and he asked me to tell him what was really going on. I remember his exact words.\\n\\n“Tell me the truth, even if you think it sounds unbelievable. If you lie to me, I can’t help you.”\\n\\nSo I told him. Everything I have told you, I told him. He sat there totally quiet, not moving, not questioning and never looking away. He didn’t even raise his eyebrows when I told him how I thought Pedersen was hurting me without ever being near me, or how I suspected Pedersen had killed Bethany’s mother somehow.\\n\\nI sat there and I half expected him to call me crazy. Instead he patted me on the shoulder and thanked me for being honest. Then he told me that he believed me.\\n\\nI was amazed. Without thinking I just blurted out “Why?”\\n\\nAnd he told me. Apparently, Mr. Hall used to teach at the same college where Mr. Pedersen taught. He said that he had never known Pedersen back then; aside from a few times they passed each other on campus.\\n\\nHe also told me that there had been a couple of very strange accident at the college. There had been a rash of vandalisms at the college campus. Some students were breaking into classrooms and spray painting things on the walls, breaking equipment, breaking into teacher’s desks, stuff like that. The last classroom that was broken into was Pedersen’s.\\n\\nTwo days later, three students, apparently drunk, crashed their car into one of the campus buildings. The students all died, and some stolen items from teachers were found in the trunk, along with spray paint in the back seat. They had been the vandals.\\n\\nThe whole campus was horrified… except Pedersen, who Hall described as being exuberant in his happiness the day after the accident. Hall wrote it off as Pedersen being a weirdo.\\n\\nLater, the campus let several teachers go. Hall and Pedersen included. The next day, the administrator who made the cuts fell down the stairs. Hall and another fired professor had been waiting near the door to talk to him when he fell. They checked on him, and Hall went to go get help.\\n\\nHe said when he left the building, he saw Pedersen just standing in the middle of the grounds, staring at the building. He described the same cold seething glare I had described Pedersen having.\\n\\nI was astonished as Hall finished the story. He told me that he and Pedersen both ending up at my school was just coincidence. He also told me that he had been keeping an eye on Pedersen ever since he saw the way he would always show up late and leave his class out in the cold.\\n\\nI didn’t know what to say. I asked Hall how Pedersen could be doing this, and he told me he had no idea. That wasn’t the answer I was hoping for, but… it was nice to have someone – an adult – who believed me.\\n\\n Finally I started getting worked up. I told Hall we had to do something. If he believed me, if he knew Pedersen was somehow responsible, then we had to stop him. Go to police. I figured they’d have to believe Mr. Hall. He was a teacher, he was a veteran! I was convinced the police would listen.\\n\\nHall brought me crashing back down to reality. He pointed out that Pedersen hadn’t done anything. He’d never actually laid his hands on me, and there was no way we could prove the accidents had actually been caused by him.\\n\\nHall drove me home, told me to keep my chin, everything would be fine. I wasn’t convinced… but that night, I didn’t have the nightmares.\\n\\nI was confident for the first time in a long time that maybe this would all work out.\\n\\nThe next day, as I’m leaving Pedersen’s class, he tells me stay behind. I suddenly became a nervous wreck. Everyone else shuffled out, and the next period wouldn’t be showing up until after lunch.\\n\\nPedersen asked me why I had been at Hall’s house. Now I was scared. I told him I hadn’t been at Hall’s house, and that’s when my knee started hurting again. I fell to the floor, Pedersen was just glaring at me. I tried to scream, but no sound came out.\\n\\nAfter a minute, the squeezing sensation stopped. Pedersen kind of shuddered and then he spoke. He told me that he wasn’t a fool, and that he knew that I knew more than I should. He told me that I was clumsy, and that if I kept up this pace I might have a serious accident.\\n\\nI knew what he was really saying. If I didn’t stop poking my nose into his business, I was going to die. I asked him why me. What had I ever done to get on his shit list? I asked me why my dreams kept screeching “Punishment!” at me.\\n\\n… his answer was not what I expected. I’m guessing it’s not what you expected either.\\n\\nHe said I was the perfect example of what was wrong with kids these days. That I was rude, that I had no respect for authority, that I was a troublemaker, a slacker and that kids like me were a disgrace.\\n\\nNow, I don’t deny his charges. I WAS rude and a slacker and I had no respect for authority. That’s all true. I was a 14 year old boy.\\n\\nBut it amazed me that THAT was his answer. That was why he was so mad. I hadn’t done anything of real consequence. I hadn’t hurt him in some way, I’d certainly made some pretty rude jokes about him, but… everyone did.\\n\\nApparently I wasn’t anything special. I hadn’t done anything more than anyone else, he just chose to single out me, Jamal and Bethany. I guess he thought we were the worst of the students. Maybe we were… but none of us did drugs. I got in a couple of fights, and so did Jamal, but way less than some students.\\n\\nBut somehow, to him, we deserved punishment. And instead of just failing us in Pre-Algebra, he was determined to make our lives hell. \\n\\nI didn’t get a chance to respond to Pedersen’s answer. The door burst open and in came Hall. Before Pedersen could say a word, Hall grabbed him by the collar and thrust him up against the wall.\\n\\nHall told Pedersen that he didn’t care what he could do, that if Pedersen hurt another student, then Hall was going to relive his days in Vietnam on Pedersen’s backside.\\n\\nPedersen looked terrified. I kept expecting Hall’s head to explode or something… but Pedersen seemed genuinely scared, and helpless. Hall hit him in the stomach and told him to quit his job. Then Hall walked me to the nurse.\\n\\nI was astonished. \\n\\nThat night I had no nightmares. The next day when I got to school, I found out that we had subs for both Pedersen and Hall’s classes. We had those subs for the rest of the week.\\n\\nI wanted to go to Hall’s house and see if he was okay, but it was too far to bike. \\n\\nThe next week when I got to school, we got a surprising announcement. Mr. Pedersen was no longer going to be teaching Pre-Algebra. Apparently he had taken a different teaching opportunity. I didn’t have the nightmares again after that.\\n\\nMr. Hall didn’t get back to school for another two weeks. When he did, he had a scar on his face, on the brim of his nose, and another one on his neck. As soon as class was over, I asked him what happened.\\n\\nHe just told me not to ask. He said it should be alright, that Pedersen was gone and he wouldn’t be back. He told me to forget everything.\\n\\nAfter that things got better. So much so that I really thought it was over. I was able to sleep again, my grades picked back up and I started losing the weight I’d gained. Best of all, we got a new teacher. She was always on time, she was a great teacher and best of all; she wasn’t vindictive and didn’t have any strange powers.\\n\\nNothing else happened for the rest of the school year. Sadly, my friendship with Jamal never recovered, and I never saw Bethany again. Over the summer I got a girlfriend named Laura, and I became good friends with her brother Craig.\\n\\nOne day when we were out riding our bikes, I suddenly felt that same squeezing sensation in my knee. I screamed and crashed my bike. I got pretty banged up. I didn’t even care, I just started looking around. Laura and Craig had run over and helped me up, but I was terrified and not paying attention to them.\\n\\nI looked around, and there he was. Pedersen’s pick up was parked on the street and he was standing in front of it. He had the same cold seething stare as he looked at me.\\n\\nThe next thing I knew, I felt the squeezing sensation again, but not on my knee. I felt it on my neck. He was choking me. I knew I was going to die. Craig and Laura were trying to help me, but they didn’t know what was happening.\\n\\nI was blacking out. My chest was burning. I knew I was going to die.\\n\\nThen I heard a terrible sound. It was like thunder and a crunch of metal. The squeezing sensation stopped, I could breathe again. When I finally at up, after a lot of coughing, I saw what happened.\\n\\nA car crashed right into the pick-up. Pedersen was caught between the two vehicles. He was dead. It was Hall’s car that crashed into him. I don’t know how Hall knew to be there, but he had crashed right into Pedersen. Hall survived the crash, but he ended up in a wheelchair from it.\\n\\nThat was pretty much the end of it. I still have problems with my knee. A year later my parents split up and I moved away from Maryland, I’ve never been back.\\n\\nI still have no idea how Pedersen did what he did. I know it wasn’t normal. \\n\\nYou don’t have to believe me. I wouldn’t believe it if I hadn’t lived through it. I’m just glad I DID live through it.\\n  \n",
       "17331   This is less of a \"scary\" story and more of a curious one. It might chill you slightly, but it offers me comfort in comparison to what I've witnessed. Consider this not as a warning, but as a foresight in what I'm about to share with you.\\n\\nIt was November in 2003, I was twelve years old. Me, my mother, my brother and my father all lived in a nice Cape Cod home together. My father had struggled with heart problems his entire life, and a line of heart-related deaths run deep into my family's history. It finally claimed his life on that 9th of November, which was a Sunday. It was literally the most traumatic day of my life. \\n\\nAfter his death I felt nothing but numbness. I tried to cope with the notion of never seeing him again. My mother took it way worse than I did, and my brother, being eighteen at the time, tried to soak it up and had to function as the new man of the house. Luckily we had family on both sides and tons of friends to come visit the night after it happened and to keep us company and share in our grief. It was a very tough time in our lives. Losing him left a giant void in all of our hearts.\\n\\nThe next morning I awoke on the couch in my living room. The night previous I had passed out I assume from all the stress I experienced the day prior. My mother was already awake in the kitchen at the table with her usual cup of coffee, and my brother was sitting across from her. I could hear them whispering quietly about our future, and that my father loved us all very much. I recall meeting them in the kitchen and sharing a three-way group hug and sobbing softly in the morning light.\\n\\nWe decided we needed to do something positive to keep ourselves occupied, because we were never one to sit and wallow in our sorrows. We had each other to depend on, and that was what kept us motivated. My mother decided to make waffles, eggs and bacon for breakfast. We sat in the kitchen all morning, talking and sharing our first laughs and celebrating in his memory what we'd do if he was here or not. Despite what we'd been through, we had a nice breakfast together. We spent the rest of the day looking over old photographs of past birthday parties, Christmases and home movies shot on our old Canon video camera, misty eyed and bitter sweet together on the sofa.\\n\\nAll week we received call after call on our house phone from relatives offering their sympathies and calls from my friends to see if I was alright and when I'd be coming back to school. Gift baskets and bouquets of flowers appeared on our door step day after day. It made us all feel quite nice. Our answering machine tape was flooded with missed calls from people who were friends of the family, so we had to clear the history. My mom went through the tapes as I sat with her in the kitchen, doing makeup homework. \\n\\nOne particular message caught our attention. It was the very last message on the tape, not quite \"fitting in\" with the others. It didn't fit in because it wasn't a message at all, rather background noise of several people talking. My mom turned the volume up on the answering machine, and we could both hear the sound of me, my mom and my brother, conversing, laughing occasionally and the clatter of silverware and plates. The message lasted for over ten minutes, and with each progressing minute, my mother's demeanor turned more and more mournful. Her eyes welled up with tears and they turned stingy and red, and she put her hand over her mouth.\\n\\nThere was a silent beat in our conversation on the tape, and at that moment my mom finally shattered the silence, \"I miss you Ben.\" The message ended, finalizing the tape.\\n\\nI'm convinced of it, my mother is convinced of it, and so is my brother. In an attempt to be with his family one last time, he chose to spend Monday morning breakfast with us in our answering machine.\\n\\nNow it's almost a decade later. I'm 20 now and I've matured a great deal. I still think of him constantly and the memories I have of him. Just recently, as we were moving back into our old house, I found the tapes of our old voice messages. The ones left by him before he passed. \"You have reached xxx-xxx-xxxx, please leave a message after the beep\". There were two voice messages left, and the last tape had our old Monday morning breakfast on it.\\n\\nI slipped the tape tenderly back into the answering machine and hit play. It was all I could do to keep from sobbing.\\n\\nThe tape still sits in our armoire in a crystal bowl with his picture next to it, and several rose petals. The petals, to this day, have not withered.

       "253641  I don’t think I’ve ever told this story before; I’ve done my best to repress the memories of that year of my life. Maybe I’ve vaguely referenced certain aspects about the ordeal here and there, it would have been impossible not to considering its impact, but I’ve never regaled it in its entirety.\\n\\nI’ve been cleaning out the basement at my mom’s house, and towards the back, buried under a mess of boxes filled with random junk and old clothes, was a small, clear,  plastic storage container. I had no idea that my mom had kept the letters.\\n\\nThe letters began not long after my best friend Ben, the kid from whom I’d been just shy of inseparable since we were three years old, was moving away. I remember being crushed that day, when Ben came up to me in our fourth grade class with puffy eyes and told me he and his mom were leaving town.\\n\\nThat night at home, my mom explained that her father, Ben's grandpa, was no longer capable of caring for himself. As such, his mom had decided to move out to the very small town in which he lived, which itself was two states over, and stay in his house until such time her assistance was no longer necessary. My mom also suggested I get their new address and give them mine, so Ben and I could write back and forth.\\n\\nAnd so we did, starting with the first letter Ben sent me, a couple months after they left.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nNovember 19th, 1999\\n\\nHey dude,\\n\\nIt’s very boring here. There is **nothing** to do. Not outside at least. But guess what…….my mom got me SO many games. Crash Team Racing, Crash Bandicoot Warped, Dino Crisis, DRIVER!!!! 007: Tomorrow Never Dies, and then these two games called Grand Theft Auto but they’re weird and the graphics are stupid. Driver is the coolest one but I haven’t played 007 too much yet because I just got it. You should come visit sometime and check out Driver. And I’m still playing Tony Hawk a lot…..duh!!!!\\n\\nThe next house is far away from ours and there’s nothing at our house that’s any fun. School is dumb too. There’s kids from 3 different towns that go to my new school my teacher said. And I already know everything there teaching. I wish I could come back home. \\n\\nOh and my mom met a old friend of hers named Joe and he’s been here a lot. He’s nice and he plays Playstation with me. I think he lets me win but he says he doesn’t.\\n\\nWe have to make our moms let you come out here or let me come back there. Dude...what if my mom would let me come live with you? We would basically be brothers. Talk to your mom and see if she would let me. I’ll talk to mine too.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nBen Nebel\\n\\nP.S. Sk8 Broz 4 Life\\n\\n_____\\n\\n\\nIt might be cringy to you, but Sk8 Broz was what we lived for back then. We were gonna be pro skateboarders. It was a dumb dream, but it was ours. \\n\\nWe generally sent a letter back and forth every week. This went on for about seven months, with us just telling each other about our weeks, what was going on with the people from our respective schools, and both of us regaling how we’d tried to convince our moms to let Mike come live with us back home.\\n\\nBut the most prevalent theme of the letters was Ben’s lamenting of the situation as a whole.\\n\\n“I wish I never had to come to this stupid house.”\\n\\n“I hate living with my grandpa. He doesn’t even remember who we are a lot.”\\n\\n“My school is the worst. All the kids there are dumb, you would hate them.”\\n\\nAt least two of these types of statements were made in each letter. That’s why it was so surprising when, after those seven months of letters of that type, there was a lull of about two months, at the end of which I received one from him, one where his attitude had seemingly completely reversed.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nSeptember 2nd, 2000\\n\\nHey Nick!\\n\\nGuess what?? I found a skatepark a few minutes away from my house, it’s sick! Since not a lot of people live here it’s not very busy that much. The woods here are pretty cool too. I think I just didn’t like them because it’s been cold. \\n\\nThis is actually a pretty fun place. Some of the kids are pretty cool actually. There not Sk8 Broz cool, but there ok. Joe bought me a Playstation 2!!! And the games Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2 and Dynasty Warriors 2!!! \\n\\nMy grandpa is still my grandpa, but he’s doing okay I guess.\\n\\nGUESS WHAT? My mom said she would pay for you guys to drive out here. She said she feels bad you haven’t come back and I haven’t come home and so she said she’ll pay!!!\\n\\nShe told me to tell you to ask your mom to take some time off work to come out and visit. In your next letter let me know when she is able to do that so my mom can too. FINALLY BRO!!!\\n\\nBen Nebel\\n\\n_____\\n\\n\\nThe last letter I’d received before that one was much like they’d always been. Unenthusiastic, withdrawn, scornful, all of his surroundings. It was a sudden switch, but I was happy for him. I kept my mom apprised of his letters, letting her know what was going on on their end of things. When it came to this letter, she finally relented and promised me she’d take some time off work in a couple months, even going so far as letting me miss school for a few days so we could visit before it got too cold and started snowing.\\n\\nI wrote him back a few days later, giving him the dates my mom had notified her firm she wouldn’t be in, as well as requesting their phone number. I got Ben’s reply very shortly thereafter.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nSeptember 12th, 2000\\n\\nHey man,\\n\\nMy mom said those days are perfect and she asked off work. FINALLY DUDE!!! There aren’t any houses to trick or treat at so we will just have to hang out on Halloween (BEST HOLIDAY EVER) but you should still bring a costume. We will have to go to the skatepark and play my PS2. Did you get a PS2?? If you did bring your games if they aren’t ones I have.\\n\\nHere is our number. Joe (my moms friend) might answer. She said your mom can call and make sure it is all ok.\\n\\nxxx-xxx-xxxx\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nBen Nebel\\n\\n_____\\n\\nMy mom did indeed call, and Ben’s mom boyfriend Joe indeed answered. He politely informed my mom that Joanna (Ben’s mom) wan’t yet back from work, but that everything as planned was good to go, and that they were excited to see us (and he to meet us), remarking that there was rarely a time that Ben didn’t relate a conversation to me/his hometown in some way, and that it would be good for him to see me. After getting and writing down the directions to their home two states over, my mom hung up the phone and informed me of the good news.\\n\\nOur plan spanned seven days: one day for driving and getting there, five days there, and a day to drive and get back home. We left on October 26th, a Thursday. I was so excited; I can’t even find the words to describe how amped up I was. I was finally going to see my closest friend, the person to whom I related most that I hadn’t seen for the better part of a year. On top of that, I was getting to miss school, and on top of *that*, it was going to be Halloween, our favorite holiday. By all accounts, this was shaping up to be a great week.\\n\\nWe made the 10 ½ hour drive and upon the last few directions my mom had been given, we found ourselves traversing long, empty roads. Finally, we made the last directed turn and in the distance we could see a house.\\n\\nDusk had settled, and it was that odd few moments where it’s light out and dark out simultaneously when we pulled up to the house. We parked next to Joanna’s van (which was “decorated” with a large dent in the driver’s side that I had made but that Ben had taken the blame for) and another car that presumably belonged to her boyfriend, Joe.\\n\\nAs we got out of the car, a man emerged from the front door of the house, wearing a Frankenstein costume.\\n\\n“Hey guys! Welcome, welcome, welcome! I’m Joe, you must be Amber and Nick! Hey Nick, a little birdie told us that your favorite holiday is Halloween, so we thought we’d start the celebration early! I hope you brought a costume!”\\n\\nI was instantly ecstatic. “I did, I brought a costume!” I yelled up to the man. \\n\\n“Well suit up, partner! We have a surprise all set up for you when you’re ready! Ben wanted to make you guys reuniting extra spectacular.”\\n\\nI asked my mom if I could change into it right away, to which she obliged. I sprinted up the porch steps with my bag and was directed by Joe to the bathroom while he stayed behind to greet my mother. As I walked through the house I heard him say “Very nice to meet you, Amber. Joanna’s finishing things in the basement. Ben set up a…”\\n\\nI remember looking around their house and finding the mess within it strange. It wasn’t exceptionally messy or anything, but Ben’s mom was always kind of a neat freak; their house never had anything out of place. This new house, however, had dirty dishes on the dining room table, piles of clothes all over the place, things like that. Again, nothing too outrageous, just uncharacteristic.\\n\\nI changed into my Power Ranger costume in the bathroom and walked back to the living room, where my mom and Joe stood talking. Besides the bit of a mess, the house was decorated for Halloween pretty elaborately. There were (obviously decorative) cobwebs all over the place, bowls of candy throughout the house, a decorative skeleton in a chair in the corner of the living room, stuff like that. I was very excited to see what they’d done with the basement.\\n\\nJoe ushered us towards the basement door and opened it to let us through, closing it behind him. There were small lights on each of the steps we used to guide us down, and once we got to the bottom of the steps, we were forced to turn left down a very narrow walkway. \\n\\nI remember being scared; the darkness and confinement was overwhelming. But I also remember my mom leaning down and whispering to me “It’s okay, Ben told Joe how much you guys liked the haunted maze you went to a couple years ago, so he built one for you guys here since there’s none around here.”\\n\\nMy mom kept her hand on my shoulder as we walked through. Lights would flash and things would pop out and drop down and loud noises would blast from speakers just like a normal haunted maze, and for being in a basement, I recall it being surprisingly well done. I heard Joe from behind my mom say “the finale is just up ahead”.\\n\\nWe made one more turn and found two small lights pointed up at a pair of dark blue curtains hanging down. \\n\\n“Let me sneak by you guys quick, come in when I tell you, he wants this to be perfect.” Joe said enthusiastically as he brushed past us and through the curtains, being sure to keep them as closed as possible so as not to ruin the surprise. \\n\\n“Ready to see your best friend? I know how much you guys have been looking forward to this!” he said from behind the curtain. And I was. It had been nearly a year since I’d seen Ben, and I was more than ready. \\n\\nAfter just a few seconds, we heard “Come in!” followed by a comical spooky laugh, like the kind a Scooby-Doo villain would make.\\n\\nI was so excited to see my best friend. My mom whispered for me to go ahead, and I walked through the curtains, and there he was, along with his mom and two other men.\\n\\nHis mom was nude, her body cut into eight pieces, all of them nailed to the wall, fashioned to make it look as if she was waving to us. Ben’s grandpa was in a rocking chair, also nude, with his hands sewn to his ankles and his feet sewn to his wrists. His mouth had been cut at the edges of his lips and his mouth was open twice as far as any person’s mouth should be able to open.\\n\\nNext to him was another man, presumably (and later confirmed to be) the real Joe , hung from a rope tied to a load-bearing beam in the ceiling, all the skin from his torso removed. His tongue was nailed into his forehead (That may have actually been Ben’s grandpa, but I don’t think so. It’s been a long time and like I said, I’ve done my best to not think about it).\\n\\nDrinking glasses of various sizes as well as saucers and bowls were strewn about the floor, all filled with blood (I’m assuming). On the wall, made from strips of the real Joe’s removed skin were the words “Missed you!”.\\n\\nTo the left was the man who had posed as Joe, who had terrified, sobbing Ben bound on his knees facing me. Ben was filthy, as if he hadn’t bathed or changed his clothes in months. Joe quickly tore away the piece of duct tape that was covering my best friend’s mouth and said “Quick! Say hi!”\\n\\nBen just continued crying. I don’t even think he had time to comprehend his chance at last words. \\n\\nThis whole thing lasted less than five seconds. I had walked through those curtains and stopped in my tracks, blocking my mom from entering the area. She had soon thereafter poked her head through and immediately pulled back from whence we’d came to run back through the “maze”.\\n\\nThe last image I have of my best friend in the world, the person with whom I shared every interest, the other half of the would-be skateboard phenom team the Sk8 Broz, was of him on his knees in front of a psychopath, sobbing, as that psychopath took a hacksaw to his neck and started thrusting his arm back.\\n\\nAs my mom repeatedly told me to “go, move, run”, all I could hear was the gurgled screams of Ben Nebel, and at one point, the loud voice of the madman who’d taken his life:\\n\\n“Oh come on! You’re not even gonna let him watch?! You’re no fun!” followed by a disturbingly calm yet loud laughter.\\n\\nWe found our way back to the stairs, where my mom told me to go outside and get in the car and lock the doors. Knowing now wasn’t the time to question her, I abided. I looked back as I ran through the hallway and saw her tip over a bookshelf in front of the basement door. \\n\\nShe was gone for about 20 seconds after that, but she finally emerged from within the house, ran to the car, and we drove away, stopping at the end of the street. She explained that she’d been looking for and eventually found a phone in their house and called the police, quickly said a murder had occurred and said she’d be at the end of the road from Ben’s house, the address to which she’d luckily put at the top of the contents of her purse when we’d gone in.\\n\\nGiven that we were in the literal middle of nowhere. It took the police nearly 20 minutes to arrive. When they did, we led them to the house, and they entered. I remember asking my mom what if the man had run away, but she told me she was confident the bookshelf was too heavy to move from the other side of the basement door,\\n\\nAs it turns out, the man hadn’t tried to get out through the basement door.\\n\\nHe hadn’t tried to get out at all.\\n\\nHe simply placed the head of my best friend on a small table next to him, wrote a note (or maybe he had it prewritten, I don’t recall), put a single-barrel shotgun in mouth and pulled the trigger.\\n\\nI will forever have the images of my best friend’s mother, her boyfriend, and her grandfather in their final stages, all the viscera and sinew that accompanies dismembered and skinned bodies. I will forever have the image of the last time my eyes laid upon my best friend, the image burned into my ten year old eyes of him him with tears streaming down his face and a hacksaw pressed against his neck.\\n\\nBut the part about that whole ordeal that sticks with me more than any of that….is the note their killer left.\\n\\n**You probably want to know why I did it, right?**\\n\\n**I don’t know...I saw an opportunity and I took it. It was pretty funny though right?**\\n\\n**Be honest :)**\\n\\n[NBH](http://www.nickbotic.com)
